<h4>Using the Builder design pattern</h4>
<p>
The builder design pattern offers a structured and readable way to create complex Objects. 
Rather than using a long and rigid constructor to instantiate multiple variables and Objects for a class instance, 
the builder design pattern enables you to set each variable as it is required when creating an instance.
<br>
While appearing more verbose, the benefits of the builder design pattern will ensure Objects are created in a 
responsible way where each property is assigned as expected.
