It was roughly 5 years ago when I wrote my first line of visual basics. I arrived home from an interview where I was questioned on 'writing macros' in Microsoft Excel, a topic I thought to be a strong-point at the time. The macro I wrote enabled me to change the background colour of a cell to red with a keyboard shortcut. It was then that I grew an unknown passion for software development.
</p>
</p>
Fast-forward to the present day and I am starting a blog to document the areas of technology that I explore, find interesting, and am challenged by on a daily basis. My experience with writing a dissertation, where I had to thoroughly introduce the technologies involved (Big Data and Blockchain) allowed me to appreciate the importance in understanding a technical concept to its core. This blog will provide me with the opportunity to continue to explore, but also to understand how and why technology works.
</p>
<p>
As I dive deeper and wider into software development, and more questions than answers become apparant, the theme to this blog will remain diverse. I expect to use this platform as another basis for growth as I begin to answer questions on how technology works, and why.

Enjoy!
