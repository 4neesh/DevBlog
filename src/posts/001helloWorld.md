It was roughly 5 years ago when I wrote my first line of 'code' using visual basics. I wrote a short macro to change the colour of a cell to red with a keyboard shortcut. My research into macros was triggered by an interview question that day that allowed me to see a new side of Microsoft Excel. The experience subsequently provided a window into the potential of automation and the realisation that even I could do it.  It wasn't actually until two years later during my Masters degree that I actually wrote 'Hello World' to any context.

Fast-forward to the present day and I am starting a blog to document the areas of technology that I explore, find interesting, and am challenged by on a daily basis. My experience with writing a dissertation, where I had to introduce the technologies involved (Big Data and Blockchain) allowed me to appreciate the contextual value in understanding a technical concept to its core components. My blog will support me with the opportunity to write bite-sized posts on just how and why the technologies I use work.

<p>
My experience of looking for answers to my technical questions has created a deluge of further doors to question. My current technology stack involves Java, AWS, and Spring, but I am sure, with time, the context of this blog will expand to other areas of technology.

Enjoy!
