<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
Roughly 5 Years on from my first line of visual basics, I have decided to begin a blog to document the technology I learn, enjoy, and find interesting. 
</p>
<p>
I expect this blog to gravitate towards my interest in Java, Spring, and AWS. Having said that, establishing this blog has required learning React.js and Graphql, so there will always be scope beyond. 
</P>
<p>
Enjoy!
