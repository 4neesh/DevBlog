It was roughly 5 years ago when I wrote my first line of 'code' using visual basics. I arrived home from a job interview for an internship where I was questioned on 'macros' in Microsoft Excel, a topic I thought to be a strong-point. Puzzled, I researched and wrote a macro that enabled me to change the background colour of a cell to red with a keyboard shortcut. It wasn't actually until two years later during my Masters degree that I actually wrote 'Hello World' to any context.

Fast-forward to the present day and I am starting a blog to document the areas of technology that I explore, find interesting, and am challenged by on a daily basis. My experience with writing a dissertation, where I had to introduce the technologies involved (Big Data and Blockchain) allowed me to appreciate the importance in understanding a technical concept to its core for longevity. My blog will support me with the opportunity to write bite-sized posts on just how and why the technologies I use work.

<p>
My current experience of looking for answers to my technical questions has consistently led to the discovery of further doors to question. My current technology stack involves Java, AWS, and Spring, but I am sure, with time, the context of this blog will expand to other areas of technology.

Enjoy!
