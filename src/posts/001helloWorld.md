It was roughly 5 years ago when I wrote my first line of code. I had attended a job interview for an internship when I was asked about writing macros to reflect upon my experience with Microsoft Excel. That evening I wrote my first macro to change the colour of a cell to red with a keyboard shortcut. Two lessons were taken from that day: there are many doors in technology that allow us to achieve things we couldn't imagine, and the advent of high-level programming languages provide a more intuitive experience writing code than one may think.
</p>
</p>
Fast-forward to the present day and I am starting a blog to document the areas of technology that I explore, find interesting, and am challenged by on a daily basis. My experience with writing a dissertation, where I had to introduce the technologies involved (Big Data and Blockchain) allowed me to appreciate the process and value of understanding a technical concept to its core. My blog will support me with the opportunity to write bite-sized posts on how and why the technologies I use work.

My expectations for this blog are that it will surround my current preferred stack of Java, Spring, and AWS. Despite this, the deluge of questions that arrive each day from my search for answers will no doubt broaden the context. Nevertheless, I am creating this website for my enjoyment and with the hope that you, the reader, may also benefit from one of the many challenges I overcome as an engineer.
</P>
<p>
Enjoy!
