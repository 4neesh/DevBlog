It was roughly 5 years ago when I wrote my first line of code. I had attended a job interview for an internship when I was asked about writing macros to reflect upon my experience with Microsoft Excel. That evening I wrote my first macro to change the colour of a cell to red with a keyboard shortcut.<br>
Two lessons were taken from that day: there are many doors in technology that allow us to achieve things we couldn't imagine, and the advent of high-level programming languages provides a more intuitive experience writing code than I could have thought.
</p>
</p>
Fast-forward to the present day and I am starting a blog to document the areas of technology that I explore, find interesting, and am challenged by on a daily basis.<br>
My experience with writing a dissertation, where I had to introduce the technologies involved (Big Data and Blockchain) allowed me to appreciate the process and value of understanding a technical concept to its core. My blog will support me with the opportunity to write bite-sized posts on how and why the technologies I use work.
</p>
<p>
My expectations for this blog are that it will surround all areas of Java, Spring, and AWS.<br>
Despite this, the deluge of questions that arrive each day from my search for answers will no doubt broaden the context.<br>
Nevertheless, I am creating this website for my enjoyment and with the hope that you, the reader, may also benefit from one of the many challenges I overcome as an engineer.
</P>
<p>
Enjoy!
