<h4>Auto-authentication</h4>
<p>
This video completes our mongodb authentication functionality by creating logout functionality. We will also
explore the local storage capability of our browser that will allow us to persist our web token to enable
automatic authentication when a user leaves the web application.

Join along with this tutorial with the source code below:
There you will find a before and after folder that contains the code at the stand and end of the video.
