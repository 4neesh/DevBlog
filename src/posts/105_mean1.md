<h4>MEAN Application: Part 1</h4>
<p>
In this 5-part series we will look at how to create a MEAN application. 
A MEAN application uses Mongo DB, Express JS, Angular and Node JS to create a full-stack application.
This first part of the series will create the bare-bones of our angular application.
We will create a personal diary that displays our posts in a table. We will be able to add, delete and update posts within the application and to store the data in an array.
