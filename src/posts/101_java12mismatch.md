<h4>A new way to compare Files with Java 12</h4>
<p>
Take a look at the new mismatch method introduced to the Files class with Java 12. 
Files mismatch will help us to determine the exact index position where the content of two files
will differ. This video will use an example of two files to see how the method can be used to 
compare the content of two files, and to see what is returned with identical and different files.
