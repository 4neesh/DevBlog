<h4>UI Authentication enhancements</h4>
<p>
This video will enhance the user interface and experience with authentication. Visual components will 
only become available if a user is authenticated to help the user understand what they can and cannot do.

There you will find a before and after folder that contains the code at the stand and end of the video.
