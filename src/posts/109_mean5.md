<h4>MEAN Application: Part 5</h4>
<p>
Part 5 of this MEAN Application series will complete our application with a MongoDB database. We are going to create an account with MongoDB and a cluster to store our data within. We will also use the mongoose package to define a schema for our data, before connecting to MongoDB and persisting the data. We will complete the full-stack functionality by enabling POST, PUT and DELETE functionality with the database and application together.
