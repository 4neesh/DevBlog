<h4>Java Stream API</h4>
<p>
This video will take a look at the Java 8 Stream, an incredibly powerful and useful API that enables us to navigate, transform and extract from Collections of Objects into new collections or Objects. 
We will firstly understand the different ways that we can create a stream and their advantages. Second, we will look at the vast array of functions that allow us to operate upon the Collections, and then lastly explore the various ways that we can aggregate our stream into a new Object or Collection.
