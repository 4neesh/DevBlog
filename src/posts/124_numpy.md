<h4>Numpy</h4>
<p>
Follow along in this Python tutorial where I introduce the basic methods and 
operations that you can perform with numpy. 
We will take a look at how you can create an array in numpy, reshaping it into different matrix sizes and selecting specific rows and columns from that matrix. 
We also dive into the different ways you can generate and obtain random numbers with numpy. 
And lastly we will conclude with some basic mathematical operations you can perform with numpy.

This video will serve as a perfect first stop with getting yourself familiar and 
confident with the numpy package from Python.
