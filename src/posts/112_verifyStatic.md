<h4>How to verify static method calls</h4>
<p>
Learn how you can verify that a static method has been called with PowerMock!
This video will look at why Mockito is unable to verify static method calls. We will then 
review the PowerMock dependencies required, and write a method that verifies if a static method is called
and the number of times it is invoked.
