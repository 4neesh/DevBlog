<h4>Java 8 Optional Class</h4>
<p>
This video will explore the Optional class and the API methods that are introduced with it in Java 8. 
The Optional class will enable you to check for null, perform default operations if a value returns null, and also use custom logic as a response on a single line.

No longer will you be required to perform repetitive and cumbersome null pointer checks in your code as you can 
conveniently handle potential nulls values with the Optional class API.
