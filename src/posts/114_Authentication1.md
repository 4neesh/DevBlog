<h4>Authentication with MongoDB Part 1</h4>
<p>
This video will look at how we can sign up users to our application and to store their details with MongoDB.
Our application will allow users to sign up with a new sign up form built within Angular. We will then connect the form
with an express endpoint to MongoDB. We will also verify accounts are unique and apply a hash to the password to help protect user information.
