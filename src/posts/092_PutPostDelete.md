<h4>Make PUT, POST and DELETE requests with a Spring web server</h4>
<p>
Learn how to create DELETE, PUT and POST endpoints to a RESTful API service built with Spring Boot. We will create these endpoints in the controller layer, and then use the Postman API Platform to make it easier for us to test the endpoints. We then verify the output from our REST calls with the connected MySQL Database.
