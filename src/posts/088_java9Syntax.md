This video will explore the 3 key syntax changes that are introduced with Java 9 from Java 8.
First we will look at how collection factory methods can be written in a neater way for immutable entries.
Then we look at how the stream api has been enhanced to introduce methods to apply filters to an ordered collection, and to remove null values from the stream. Lastly we look at how private methods can be used within an interface, and when they may be required.
