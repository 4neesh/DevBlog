<strong>Key Takeaways</strong><br>
&#8226; Understand what an Options contract is and why it is used.<br>
&#8226; Take a brief look into the mathematical models that are used to derive the price of an options contract within a market.<br>

<br>
<h4>What is an Options derivative</h4>
<p>
An options derivative, also known as an options contract, defines an agreement between two counterparties where the buyer of the contract has the <u>option</u> and NOT the obligation, to buy or sell a particular asset at a particular quantity within a certain time frame.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, when we create an options contract, there are 4 key variables defined:<br>
1. If the buyer of the contract has the option to <strong>buy</strong> or <strong>sell</strong> the asset.<br>
2. What the price of the asset will be when bought or sold, known as the <u>Strike price</u>.<br>
3. The <u>quantity</u> of the asset to be bought or sold.<br>
4. The <u>maturity</u> of the options contract when it is no longer valid.
</p>
<p>
The time when the options contract can be exercised is determined by its type. European options can be exercised only at expiry, whereas American options can be exercised any time before. Bermudan options on the other hand will have set intervals when it can be exercised leading up to the maturity (such as once per month).
</p>

<br>
<h4>The different types of Option contracts</h4>
<p>
As mentioned above, an option contract will entitle, but not obligate the buyer to either buy or sell a particular asset at a strike price by the maturity date.<br>
An option contract that entitles the holder to buy an asset is called a <strong>Call option</strong>. An option contract that entitles the holder to sell an asset is called a <strong>Put option</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Option contracts are not limited to only a single market or participant, options contract are traded for a variety of purposes due to their many advantages we will discuss later.
Options contracts exist for commodities, stocks, bonds, interest rates, currencies and also for swaps, known as 'Swaptions'. There are many other markets for Options, these are some of the more popular ones traded upon through an exchange.<br>
One example of Options contracts traded without an exchange are <u>Dealer options</u>. Dealer options are used to trade commodities over the counter (OTC) without a centralised exchange. The benefit of OTC trading are the personalised terms that can be agreed upon, thus enabling both counterparties to achieve a more bespoke agreement. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Why Options are used</h4>
<p>
So we can now understand what an option contract is, what its key properties are and the many forms it can take in the market, but why are they used?
</p>
<p>
As repeated in this blog, the Options contract provides the right, and not the obligation for a counterparty to transact upon the terms of the derivative.<br>
This property of an Options contract means they can be used with huge flexibility and present ample opportunities for both hedging and speculative incentives. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hedging strategies</strong><br>

</p>
<p>
Cap and floor certain floating points. 

+ves:
- hedge risk from market changes
- speculate on market movement
- speculate on movement up and down in the market
- Can be structured to the exact needs of the customer. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>How an Option contract is priced</h4>
<p>
Option Premium - paid to the option writer. 
'Intrinsic value' = current price and future strike price. 
+ time value
+ level of price volatility

Prices reflect companies own views on future price movements. 

Time = days to years
