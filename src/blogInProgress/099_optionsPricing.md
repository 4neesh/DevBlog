<strong>Key Takeaways</strong><br>
&#8226; Understand what an Options contract is and why it is used.<br>
&#8226; Take a brief look into the mathematical models that are used to derive the price of an options contract within a market.<br>

<br>
<h4>What is an Options derivative</h4>
<p>
An options derivative, also known as an options contract, defines an agreement between two counterparties where the buyer of the contract has the <u>option</u> and NOT the obligation, to buy or sell a particular asset at a particular quantity within a certain time frame.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, when we create an options contract, there are 4 key variables defined:<br>
1. If the buyer of the contract has the option to <strong>buy</strong> or <strong>sell</strong> the asset.<br>
2. What the price of the asset will be when bought or sold, known as the <u>Strike price</u>.<br>
3. The <u>quantity</u> of the asset to be bought or sold.<br>
4. The <u>maturity</u> of the options contract when it is no longer valid.
</p>
<p>
The time when the options contract can be exercised is determined by its type. European options can be exercised only at expiry, whereas American options can be exercised any time before. Bermudan options on the other hand will have set intervals when it can be exercised leading up to the maturity (such as once per month).
</p>

<br>
<h4>The different types of Option contracts</h4>
<p>
As mentioned above, an option contract will entitle, but not obligate the buyer to either buy or sell a particular asset at a strike price by the maturity date.<br>
An option contract that entitles the holder to buy an asset is called a <strong>Call option</strong>. An option contract that entitles the holder to sell an asset is called a <strong>Put option</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Option contracts are not limited to only a single market or participant, options contract are traded for a variety of purposes due to their many advantages we will discuss later.
Options contracts exist for commodities, stocks, bonds, interest rates, currencies and also for swaps, known as 'Swaptions'. There are many other markets for Options, these are some of the more popular ones traded upon through an exchange.<br>
One example of Options contracts traded without an exchange are <u>Dealer options</u>. Dealer options are used to trade commodities over the counter (OTC) without a centralised exchange. The benefit of OTC trading are the personalised terms that can be agreed upon, thus enabling both counterparties to achieve a more bespoke agreement. 
</p>
<p>
The variety of options contract available to investors make them highly personalised and present one key advantage to using them.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Why Options are used</h4>
<p>
So we can now understand what an option contract is, what its key properties are and the many forms it can take in the market, but why are they used?
</p>
<p>
As repeated in this blog, the Options contract provides the right, and not the obligation for a counterparty to transact upon the terms of the derivative.<br>
This property of an Options contract means they can be used with huge flexibility and present ample opportunities for both hedging and speculative incentives. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hedging strategies</strong><br>
A hedging strategy may use an option contract to protect themselves from both the upward and downward movement of an interest rate.<br>
For example, if we take a floating point interest rate that is currently 0.16%, a bank may with to take an options contract that allows them to receive payment each time the interest rate exceeds 2% and falls below 1.12%. This hedging strategy is known as a cap and floor, where the bank are capping the maximum interest rate they are exposed to at 0.2% and the minimum rate of 0.12%.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Speculative strategies</strong><br>
On the contrary, the options contract can enable an investor to benefit from the movement of an underlying asset's price, as they are able to exercise against their right when the price is deemed 'in the money'. 
As a speculator, the benefit of an options contract can present unlimited upside, with a limited downside (the premium paid for the contract). For example, if an options contract enables an investor to buy 100kg of wheat for £1000, and the cost of the options contract is just £50, the investor will have a limited downside of £50, but a potential upside determined by the upward price of wheat within the market. If 100kg of wheat rises to £2000, the investor can make a £950 profit from exercising their options contract, whereas if the price of wheat remains below £1000, they will only ever lose the £50 premium paid up front. 
</p>
<p>
When considering a hedging or speculative strategy, the benefit is realised by the holder of the contract only when it is exercised. At expiry, the options contract is deemed worthless, and the benefit of the optiosn contract creation lies with the seller of the contract. With this in mind, you may wonder how the price of an option contract is derived, and the factors that play into its value throughout it's life. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>How an Option contract is priced</h4>
<p>
Option Premium - paid to the option writer. 
'Intrinsic value' = current price and future strike price. 
+ time value
+ level of price volatility

Prices reflect companies own views on future price movements. 

Time = days to years
