<h4>Intro to Go programming language</h4>
<p>
Go (often referred to as 'Golang') was created by 3 engineers, Ken Thompson, Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer who worked together at Google during the time of the creation of Go.
Go is a programming language that was used to tackle some of the problems faced at Google, however it is not a Google product as-such.
Golang is an open source programming language designed to offer 3 levels of distinction from the existing market of programming languages.
Docker is currently used by major companies and is used to build platforms such as Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform and more. But what makes Golang so great?
</p>
<p>
The motivation behind Golang extends to 3 distinct features that otherwise were not sufficiently supported by most mainstream languages:<br>
&#8226; Efficient compilation.<br>
&#8226; Efficient execution.<br>
&#8226; Ease of programming.<br>
While languages such as Java provides efficient compilation and execution, languages such as JavaScript and Python are able to provide the ease of programming with efficient compilation, however without the efficient execution. 
Golang aims to achieve this tri-standard in a single language.

<h4>Language Properties</h4>
<p>
Go is a statically typed, compiled and highly optimised programming language. 
A goal of Go is to achieve rapid compilation. 
Being statically typed, the type safety of Go is verified by the program to offer an optimisation to the compiled binary output. 
As the compiler is not required to perform dynamic safety checks, Go is able to run faster than those which are.
The compiler to Go is well depended upon as it provides support to the developer for optimisation in a C-inspired manner.
All in all, Go offers improved compilation and reduced clutter as a statically typed language.
Beyond the compiler, Go uses garbage collection for efficient memory allocation and management for the developer and also uses multiple paradigms 
</p>
<p>
Go support a multi-paradigm programming language where paradigm such as OOP and procedural code can be used as required by the developer.
</p>
<p>
Go places its value across 5 key properties to the language:<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Simplicity</strong><br>
Go removes the potential difficulty of using expressions as components to a statement. Instead, statements are expressed as entire units on their own.
The objective of Go simplicity is to make the code as clear to how it works.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concurrency</strong><br>
Go features its own network awareness where threads can be executed in a thread-safe manner. Go includes a package called 'net/http' which provides web application support.
The package allows the developer to build HTTP services with compositional constructs. 
GO features support for multi-threaded development with <strong>goroutines</strong> which are functions that run concurrently. A goroutine is a lightweight thread that can be run with 
thousands of other goroutines.
Goroutines are able to safely communicate with each other through channels using the go schedular to assign threads to tasks. Channels prevent the potential for race conditions when multiple 
goroutines access shared memory. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Out of the box experience</strong><br>
Go achieves an enhanced user experience from its capacity to be used out of the box. 
You are not required to pull libraries to be used with Go as comprehensive support for tools are provided as default with Go. 
The Go standard library comes with exceptional support for core components including:<br>
&#8226; String manipulation.<br>
&#8226; Data compression.<br>
&#8226; Network APIs.<br>
&#8226; File manipulation.<br>
&#8226; Testing APIs.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Go CLI offers further support for an out-of-the-box experience. The CLI provides support for project initialisation, building, code generation, dependency retrieval, documentation and web server hosting. The test suite also allows the developer to test code. The application profile also performs analysis upon the application consumption of CPU, network, goroutines and requirements. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cross-platform use</strong><br>
Go supports building applications across different operating systems with the update of 2 variables to the compiler. 
The support of Go for cross-platform builds are that builds for different OS' can be made from the same OS and the update of 2 variables. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Use cases for Go</h4>
<p>
The primary use cases for Go extend to web services, web applications, DevOps and machine learning. 
While Go is less associated directly with machine learning, the construct of the language appeals to the former 3 with strength.
</p>
<p>
Web Services are supported by Go through their concurrent threading, message delivery and network awareness.
</p>
<p>
Web applications are supported with user experience and html
</p>
<p>
Kubernetes is written in Go and supports DevOps.
