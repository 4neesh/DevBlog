<h4>Getting started</h4>
<p>
I would begin with Atomic Habits, to understand why habits form, how we can encourage the development of good habits and how we can discourage and stop the bad ones. As the book states, it is better to begin with action, not motion. Therefore practicing planning a day, achieving objectives at certain times and places is the next step.
