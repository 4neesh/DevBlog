<strong>Key Takeaways</strong><br>
&#8226; Understand how to store and manage files using GitHub.<br>
&#8226; Use Git flows to manage branches and make requests for the branches to be included in the main branch.<br>
&#8226; Understand how you can obtain the latest updates from the main branch into the local repository.<br>

<br>
<h4>What is Git and version control?</h4>
<p>
Git is a distributed version-control system that enables you to manage your code and updates in a centralised repository.
Git stores snapshots of the source code each time it is saved to enable you to revise historical updates to source code and track changes.
We use Git, and other version control systems to control the updates and revisions made to source code to minimise the potential for code regression in a distributed contribution environment. 
</p>
<p>
While version control is most valuable within teams and open-source environments, it is equally applicable to single-developer projects; version control is important across software engineering practices as it formalises the process of creating, updating, and reviewing code before it is submitted to the main application source code base.
</p>
<p>
In this blog post, I will be using GitHub to manage my source code. GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a GUI for interacting and collaborating with Git repositories.
Git is used to store your local source code in a remote location. It is from the remote (online) location that the repository can be accessed by all members of a team and updated and reviewed in unison.

</p>
<br>
<h4>Creating a repository</h4>
<p>
A repository can first be created in GitHub from the website by selecting 'New Repository'.
</p>
<p>
The first step to do is to create a directory in your local machine for the git source code.
In the command line, navigate to the respective directory and initialise it as a Git repository with the following command:

```
git init
```
</p>
<p>
<i>Git init</i> will create a .git file in the directory that creates an empty repository. The initilisation makes available other git commands that can be used to begin adding the source code into the repository.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Adding code updates</h4>
<p>
The first addition of code to the repository will include a single print line which is saved into a file of the directory where <i>git init</i> was called:
</p>

```java{numberLines:true}
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello from the main branch");
    }
}
```
<p>
The GitHub repository is currently empty and the our directory contains source code that is yet to be added. 
The following command line instructions from the directory with the .git file can be used to move the source code into GitHub.
</p>

```
git status
```
<p>
<i>git status</i> allows you to inspect a repository. The command will display the current state of the directory against which changes are staged and which files are not tracked by git.
The status will inform you which files are stages, unstaged and untracked.<br>
Staged files are files that have been added to the current file history and are to be pushed into the Remote repository in GitHub on the next 'push' command (more on 'push' later)<br>
Unstaged files are file that are currently tracked by Git, but have been updated and not to be added into the remote repository upon the next 'push' command<br>
Untracked files are brand-new files that are not acknowledged within the Git history at any point.
</p>

```
git add .
```
<p>
<i>git add .</i> is the first instruction that tells Git to save a snapshot of the current project state into the git commit history.<br>
When you later review all the updates to the source code, you will be able to review against each state of the source code each time <i>git add .</i> was called.<br>
The '.' that follows the keyword 'add' instructs git to add all updates that are possible within the directory and sub-directories. It is also possible to replace '.' with specific files 
to include in snapshot only.<br>
Once <i>git add .</i> is called, the files are moved to the staging area and are ready to be committed to the remote repository.
</p>
<p>
<i>git add .</i> will ensure all untracked files become tracked and all unstaged changed become staged.
</p>

```
git commit -m "my first commit"
```
<p>
<i>git commit -m"my first commit"</i> is used to create a new revision of the source code that includes the previous version and all the files staged from the previous call(s) to 'git add'.
<br>
Each commit command must be made with a comment. <i>-m "my first commit"</i> is the command instruction to include the comment in the speech marks. It is best practice to include a comment that describes the update made, and the problem that the commit is resolving. 
</p>

```
git push -u origin <git url.git>
```
<p>
<i>git push</i> will take the current staged commit and push it into the remote repository. The above command includes three further command instructions as it includes the very first commit to the repository.
<i>-u</i> instructs git that it is making an upstream push into the origin. 'origin' is the default name for the remote repository.
The upstream command is implied 
</p>
<br>
<h4>Copying source code from the remote into the local copy</h4>
<p>
The following sections will describe how to create and manage branches from a git repository.
You can copy a remote repository into your local machine with the following command:
</p>

```
git clone <repository url.git>
```
<p>
The clone of the repository will be the main branch. You can then extend your own branch from the working copy on your machine.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Why we branch code</h4>
<p>
Branching is important with version control as it allows a controlled copy of the code to be practiced upon.
Branching allows us to make changes to a controlled environment and also allows a rudimentary control of events for publishing and reviewing updates to the code (more on pull requests later).
</p>



<br>
<h4>Branching to make changes</h4>
<p>
Before we can create a branch from the current main repository, we need to create a working copy that is linked to the current repository. For this, we use <i>git fork</i>.<br>
Git fork allows you to make updates to the code without affecting the current working copy. Forking is the first part of 4 steps to update an existing source code:<br>
1. (If you do not own the central repository) Fork the repository from the remote central location to the remote personal location. 
2. Clone the forked repository from the remote personal location to the local location
3. Apply a fix or update
4. Submit a pull request for the update to be included in the remote central location. 
</p>
<p>
I will first create a fork of the repository by selecting "Fork" on the GitHub repository page.

![Fork Repo](../../src/images/017_fork.png)

</p>
<p>
The Forked repository will now exist in your own GitHub remote account. Select the repository and copy the URL that appears under the "Code" tab. 

</p>

![Clone Repo](../../src/images/017_clone.png)

<p>
In the command line, navigate to the directory where you would like to store the cloned repository and use the command line to create a copy of the forked repository:

```
git clone <forked repository URL>
```
</p>

![Fork Clone diagram](../../src/images/017_forkClone.png)


<p>
To begin making a branch, perform the following command from your directory:
</p>

```
git checkout -b "firstBranch"
```

You can see all the available branches by running the following command:

```
git branch -a
```
<p>
A new branch has now been created called firstBranch.

![First branch from main](../../src/images/017_firstBranch.png)

</p>
<p>
In the command line, we are able to check the branch we are currently on with 'git status'
</p>
```
on branch firstBranch
```
<p>
The main branch can be accessed by using the following command:
</p>
```
git checkout main
```

<p>
The 'git status' command will now read as "on branch main"
</p>
<p>
We will navigate to the firstBranch again and apply a single update to the source code:

```java{numberLines:true}
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello from the main branch");
        System.out.println("Hello from the first branch");
    }
}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
```
</p>
<p>
The first branch is updated using the following commands:<br>
&#8226; git add .<br>
&#8226; git commit -m "first branch print line"<br>
</p>
<p>
The first branch now has an update that we would like to add to the main branch. You can see the differences between the two branches (main and firstBranch) by using the following command to switch between branches:

```
git checkout main
```
</p>

<p>
To submit the change to the main branch, we submit the following pull request to the main branch:
```
git push --set-upstream origin firstBranch
```
The firstBranch has not specified where it is pushing the latest update to. The upstream target is the origin (main) branch so we set the upstream branch as origin.
As a result, the firstBranch has submitted a <i>pull request</i> to the main branch.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Making a pull request</h4>
<p>
The upstream push from the firstBranch has created a new pull request in the main branch.
The pull request can be reviewed in GitHub from the main repository page:

![Pull request on main](../../src/images/017_pullRequest.png)

The following page allows you to submit the pull request with comments to the maintainers of the main repository.

![Pull Request review](../../src/images/017_pullRequestReview.png)

If you are the owner of the repository, the pull request merge option will be seen as below after any conflicts are reviewed:

![Pull Request review](../../src/images/017_mergePull.png)
</p>

<br>
<h4>Updating branches with the latest change</h4>
<p>
The main branch from the application has now been updated with the additional line written from the firstBranch. Our local copy of the main branch has not reflected the  update, however.
To obtain the latest update from the remote repository into the local repository, we use the following command:

```
git pull
```
<i>git pull</i> performs two actions:<br>
First, git pull performs a <i>git fetch</i> command to download the latest commits, file, and references from the remote repository into the local repository.
Second, git pull will integrate the new data into the working files.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
In this post I have used Git version control to branch a main repository, clone it into my own local machine, and to submit a pull request for review and inclusion in the main application source code. The updates to the remote source code is then pulled locally with Git to maintain the latest working copy in my machine.
</p>
<p>
Git is a powerful version control tool used across the industry in different forms (such as svn or mercurial). The flows of forking a repository, pulling changes from the remote version and submitting pull requests are important to understand and use appropriately to avoid unwanted side-effects from code enhancements and bug fixes.
</p>
<p>
Working with Git is incredibly important within a team and open-source environment; use the techniques from this blog to develop patterns of pulling, updating, and submitting code updates in a safe manner across branches and pull requests in open or even your own closed repositories.
