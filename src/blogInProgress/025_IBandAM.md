<h4>Introducing blog posts about financial services</h4>
<p>
I have been posting blogs about software engineering practices for the past 5 months and have decided to begin writing about financial services. The importance of understanding technical concepts within my job is equally as important as understanding the business decisions and operations.
</p>
<p>
This blog post will kick off a series of other posts that look into the financial services industry, how it works, and how technology is forcing major players to transform their traditional practices to remain competitive.

<h4>Financial services: Matching buyers and seller</h4>
<p>
Financial services can be split into two broad categories: retail and investment banking. Both services involve the matching of buyers and sellers, however the scale and characteristics of the instrument being bought and sold, and the customers involved, are what separate the two. 
</p>
<p>
When we think about retail banking, this is a service often provided to families and homeowners who would like a loan or mortgage for their livelihoods. The bank will offer a loan to the mortgage buyers with an interest rate of 'r' on the repayments. The bank will also accept deposits from their customers who wish to save their excess money. The deposits are enticed for the customers as they will receive an interest on their savings at an interest rate of 's'. The retail bank will earn money through the loan repayments where 'r' is greater than 's'. This is a very general idea of retail banking in the public sector, however the remainder of this post will look into the operations of an investment bank.

<p>
An investment bank, on the other hand, deals with the buyers and sellers that are corporations, high net worth individuals, and government entities. Investment banking is often thought of as a more attractive side of banking as the quantities of money handled are greater, and therefore the risk and return opportunities are larger. Alongside investment banking come a whole new set of ever changing regulation, controls, and mitigation that are required to assert the responsible management of funds.

The following section looks into the 'sell' and 'buy' side of investment banking. Just like retail banking involves selling mortgages to customers and buying savings from customers, investment banking involves services to match the two sides of banking.

<br>
<h4>Buy side vs sell side</h4>
<p>
The umbrella term 'investment banking' can often take different definitions and meaning. Within the context of this blog post, I have separated 'financial services' into 'retail' and 'investment' banking, and I will begin breaking investment banking into 'buy' and 'sell' side services. Investment banking is often associated with the 'sell' side of banking, whereas 'asset management' is associated with the 'buy' side of financial services. In reality, 'Investment banks' can offer both buy and sell services, whereas asset management banks will offer only buy services.

Within investment banking, there are several services provided that account for the
