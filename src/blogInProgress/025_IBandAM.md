<h4>My first blog on financial services...</h4>
<p>
For the past 5 months, (my first 5 months of blogging) I have written about the software engineering practices I use in my job. I have decided to begin writing about financial services as well as software engineering to reflect upon the context of my job, and to consolidate my understanding for the business I work within. I find the financial services industry to be engaging to learn and follow with the growing role of technology to shape the strategies of banks.
</p>
<p>
This blog post will dive into the financial services industry, how it works, and how technology is forcing major players to transform their traditional practices to remain competitive.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Introduction to financial services</h4>
<p>
Financial services can be split into two broad categories: retail and investment banking. Both services involve the matching of buyers and sellers, however the two categories differ by the scale and instruments that are consulted upon, and the characteristics of the customer to the bank.
</p>
<p>
When we think about retail banking, this is a service often provided to families and homeowners who would like a loan or mortgage for their livelihoods. The bank will offer a loan to the mortgage buyers with an interest rate of 'r' on the repayments. On the other side, the retail bank will also accept deposits from their customers who wish to save their excess money. The customer is enticed to deposit their excess money for an interest repayment on their savings, let's say at a rate of 's'. The retail bank will earn a profit through the loan repayments where 'r' is greater than 's'. This is a general idea of retail banking in the public sector, however the remainder of this post will look into the operations of an investment bank.
</p>
<p>
An investment bank, on the other hand, deals with buyers and sellers that are corporations, high net worth individuals, and government entities. Investment banking is often thought of as a larger sums of money are handled and the opportunity for larger profits and bonuses are prevalent. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Divisions of an investment bank</h4>
<p>
The umbrella term 'investment bank' can often take different definitions and meaning. 'Investment bank' must not be mistaken for 'investment banking division' which describes collectives activities of an investment bank. The investment bank will include many divisions which can help group the services provided by the bank, whether that be based upon the information they require or the clients they cater towards. The divisions of a bank also supports the regulatory compliance towards information sharing, I will later touch upon this topic.
</p>
<p>
The image below illustrates the divisions that can exist within an investment bank.

The 'Chinese wall' that splits the investment banking division from the rest is a virtual information barrier to separate non-public information and public information. The investment banking division will often have access to non-public information due to their research services, and must therefore comply to a chinese wall to prevent insider information from spilling into the other divisions.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Core services provided within the investment bank</h4>
<p>
In the following section, I will describe the core services of each division. The terms 'buy side' and 'sell side' are often used to describe the nature of revenue generation for the service, I have briefly defined them:
<br>
<i>Buy side: services involved with directly investing capital.</i><br>
<i>Sell side: services involved with raising or capital for a client.</i>
</p>
<h5><strong>Investment banking division (IBD)</strong></h5>
<p>
<strong>Underwriting</strong><br>
Underwriting is one of the primary services provided within IBD. The process of underwriting sees the bank support a client (business, corporation, government) with raising capital through the sale of stock (equity) or bonds (debt). The investment bank will profit from a percentage of the overall value of the underwritten securities.
</p>
<p>
The underwriting process can take the form of either an initial public offering (IPO) or a follow-on offerings. An IPO refers to the process of offering the shares of a private corporation to the general public. As a result, the issuance of new stock is used to raise capital for the corporation. A follow-on offering is the issuance of stock after the IPO. During the IPO, the investment bank will make one of three agreements for underwriting:<br>
&#8226; Full commitment. The investment bank will buy all the securities and sell them in a secondary market.<br>
&#8226; Best efforts. A good faith promise is made to sell as much of the security as possible.<br>
&#8226; All or none. The IPO will only go ahead if all the securities are sold.<br>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Market Making</strong><br>
As a market maker, an investment bank can act on both sides of the sale for a security. A bid (buy) and ask (sell) price can be quoted by the investment bank and a profit can be realised from the spread (ask - buy) of the security when it is later sold. The investment bank will take on a risk of holding a security as it may depreciate with time, however their market making services provide liquidity to a security that otherwise is unable to be sold in other markets.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Advisory</strong><br>
Advisory services include research and guidance on M&A (merger and acquisition) and corporate strategy.
</p>
<p>
The M&A advisory service includes the negotiation and structuring of a merger or acquisition between two corporations. The corporations can be public or private, and the investment bank are able to provide support through their expansive network to find partners and deep-grained industry knowledge on the markets.
</p>
<p>
Corporate strategy advisory can be used to support the short and long-term strategic direction of corporations in the ways of financing change.
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>Asset management division</strong></h5>
<p>
The asset management division is responsible for growing a fund with investments that cater to the client's risk tolerance and short and long term goals. Investments will be made across many instruments including stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and derivatives. The client can be high net worth individuals as well as high-end institutions. The relationship between a client and the fund manager is important to maintain as the clients may seek support in reevaluating goals or understanding the opportunities that lie ahead.
</p>
<p>
Funds will be managed by a portfolio managers who will utilise the research and guidance of their teams to make investment decisions upon the fund. The fund will have a specific criteria such as the risk tolerance, type of securities that are invested upon, and the liquidity of the fund to adhere to.
</p>

<br>
<h5><strong>Capital Markets division</strong></h5>
<p>
Capital markets are where suppliers with excess capital and those in need of capital meet to satisfy their ambitions. Capital markets in this sense are similar to retail banks with mortgages and savings accounts however the entities involved are corporations, governments and individuals. Securities are exchanged within primary markets of newly issued securities and secondary markets for re-sold securities. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sales</strong><br>
The sales component of capital markets will be responsible for suggesting trading ideas to their clients and to take orders from them. The sales component will also consist of financial analysts that provide support in research and strategies. The order will then be communicated to the trading desks where they are priced and executed. Jordan Belfort is a famous stockbroker who had a job within sales. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Proprietary Trading</strong><br>
</p>
'Prop' trading is conducted by a special set of traders who invest directly within the capital markets themselves on behalf of the bank, and not the client. The investment bank will directly profit from the market activity as opposed to the margins from client profits they realise. 
<p>
<strong>Structuring</strong><br>
Structured products provide access for retail investors to derivatives (swaps, futures, options) by using complex strategies to switch the underlying payment flows of a security with a fixed value that is derived from a derivative. The complexity of a structured product will require a blog itself to explain, however the summary is that it provides access for retail investors to derivatives.
</p>

<br>
<h5><strong>Private Banking division</strong></h5>
<p>
The private banking division is split into private banking services and wealth management services.
</p>
<p>
Private banking accommodates high net worth individuals (HNWI) to provide advice for personalised care of their finances. The services within private banking will revolve around a very close relationships and a strong sense of trust between the bank and the client. The advisory service provided by the bank will support the client to achieve their goals of asset growth and retention as well as accommodating for considerations on tax and inheritance.
</p>
<p>
Wealth management will incorporate the activities of private banking with the inclusion of trade execution for investments on behalf of the client. The difference between private banking and wealth management is the goal of fund growth and investment that accrues with wealth management.
</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>Private Equity division</strong></h5>
<p>
The private equity division will consult privately traded companies that have not yet gone public through an IPO. The client, in this case, are private corporations. 
</p>
