<strong>Key Takeaways</strong><br>
&#8226; What is basis risk and how it came about.<br>
&#8226; Why banks care about basis risk.<br>

<br>
<h4>Placing investments and hedging risk</h4>
<p>
When a financial institution engage in an investment, they are taking a position whereby they expect a return for their investment, however on the contrary are willing to accept a level of risk that the return may not be fully delivered. The possibility for lower than expected returns can be captured as the risk of the investment. 
</p>
<p>
Risk with any investment can come in a number of sizes and categories; for example: market risk from the economic impacts of the entire market, liquidity risk from not having the capital to use for other purposes, credit risk, that the company will be unable to repay the interest on your investment, such as for bonds. 
</p>
<p>
The collective risks that are faced by the investment are forecasted and either accepted by the institution, or reduced through hedging.

<h4>Spot prices vs Futures prices</h4>
<p>
To understand how basis risk is calculated, we need to understand the difference between a spot price and a futures price. 
A spot price, is the price paid for an investment/security/anything at a given time. For example, when you go shopping at a supermarket, you're in theory paying the spot price for your groceries. 
A futures price is the price for an asset to be delivered in the future. 
For example, a spot price for a StockA might be £2.00 today, but a futures price for it might be £2.03 to be delivered in 5 weeks time. One security can have many different futures prices for it as the time-frame for when the security will be delivered will be different. 
</p>
<p>
The spot price is equal to the futures price is the time on the futures contract is 0. If it is not, then an opportunity for arbitrage arises. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Using a futures contract</h4>
<p>
The basis risk for any security can be derived from the difference between its spot price and its future price.
So how do we hedge against the different price of the asset and the future?
The hedge for the future price of an asset can be used with the futures contract. 
Buying a futures contract will secure the price of the asset to be delivered/bought in the future. 
If you are selling a product, you would be naturally long in the market, so the price risk can be hedged with a short position. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>The basis risk</h4>
<p>
In the ideal world, the price of the futures contract bought will be equal to what is expected in the future. 
However the future market is not predictable and the price of the future contract can change. 
The challenges in finding a perfect futures contract is due to having a futures for different underlying assets, or a different futures maturity date. 
The underlying asset may be priced differently
the time horizon not at maturity may be trading at a discount or premium. Only at maturity are the prices of spot and futures convergent.
