<h4>Vega and the Greeks</h4>
<p>
'The greeks' are defined within finance as a group of different dimensions of risk that are taken when opening a position with an options contract. 
There are 4 common risk exposures within the greeks: Delta, Gamma, Theta and Vega, each represent a different element of risk that is exposed from the contract. 
</p>
<p>
This blog will focus upon Vega, which is a measure upon an option's sensitivity to the implied volatility of the asset. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>The options contract</h4>
<p>
An options contract is a derivative that provides the buyer of the contract the <u>right</u>, but not the <u>obligation</u> to exercise the promise of the contract. At a very high level, an options contract can be split into two: a <strong>call option</strong> which provides the buyer the right to buy an asset at a stated price within the time-frame, and a <strong>put option</strong> which provides the buyer the right to sell an asset at a stated price within the time-frame. 
</p>
<p>
Option contracts come in different 'flavours'. You can have European and American options; where a European option can only be exercised at the contracts maturity, whereas the American option can be exercised at any time up to maturity. Contrary to both, there are also Bermudan options, that can be exercised at predetermined dates (often one day per month) up to the maturity.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Option pricing</h4>
<p>
The price of an option represents the 'premium' paid by the buyer to have the right to exercise the contract. 
The price of the option is determined by many variables including the current market price of the asset, the strike price for the asset in the contract, volatility in the market and the time until the contract expires. 
</p>
<p>
The volatility in the market 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Vega - Option volatility</h4>
<p>
Vega is a measurement that is used to capture the price sensitivity of an option to a change of 1% in the underlying asset's implied volatility.
</p>
<p>
Implied volatility represents the view the market has on the likelihood that an asset's price will change. Implied volatility differs from historical/statistical volatility that reflects upon the past market changes in the asset's price. 
</p>
<p>
Implied volatility is denoted by the sigma (Ïƒ) symbol. The volatility of an asset is likely to be higher during bearish markets, where equity prices are expected to fall, and lower during a bullish market. The volatility of an asset price does not represent the direction of the price change, it can go up or down, however the size of the swings will be larger or smaller depending on implied volatility. 
</p>
<p>
Implied volatility has an impact on Options prices.
The implied volatility provides a probability when estimating future option prices. 
As implied volatility represents market opinion, this relationship can help impact options pricing. 
Higher implied volatility will result in higher premiums on the Option.
