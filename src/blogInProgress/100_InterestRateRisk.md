<h4>Bonds vs Interest Rates</h4>
<p>
This blog is going to look at interest rate risk, that is, the risk of a change in interest rates to an investment or portfolio of investments. Generally speaking when we talk about interest rate risk, we will look at bonds. Bonds are most highly exposed to interest rate risk because of their relationship with them
</p>
<p>
When an investor purchases a bond, they will receive coupon repayments at the agreed percentage rate of the principal amount. Bonds are considered low-risk due to their promise to return the principal amount back to the buyer at expiry. Similarly, an investor can leave their money in a bank account to receive an annual interest repayment on their capital, and the same guarantee that their capital will be available to them when they decide to withdraw it. A further benefit of leaving capital in a bank account is that it is readily available to withdraw at any time. Unlike a bond, that leaves the invested capital locked in until maturity, unless the bond is sold on the market. 
</p>
<p>
The opportunity to an investor, to either purchase a bond or to leave their money in a bank account to accrue interest creates an inverse relationship between interest rate movements and the value of a bond. Let's take an example to understand this better:<br>
An investor has £100 and can purchase a 2 year bond that returns 3% coupons each year. After year 1, the investor will receive £3 and then £3 plus the principal £100 after year 2. A total return of £6. <br>
At the same time of the investment, the bank rate was 2% when the bond was bought, so the investor could have left their money in the bank to earn £2 each year and to then withdraw all their capital when they want. After 2 year they will earn £4 in interest repayments. 
</p>
<p>
This example is largely simplified, excluding credit risk and the benefit of withdrawing capital early, but we can now see an opportunity in the bond for the investor to achieve greater returns for their capital over the savings account. But let's say the interest rate is 4% instead of 2%. All of a sudden, the investor is able to receive £4 a year for their £100 deposit as opposed to £3 in their bond investment. The value of the bond is now reduced from it's par value as the opportunity to the investor to receive better returns sit with the savings account. This is how the inverse relationship between bonds and interest rates is built.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Bond price factors and interest rate risk</h4>
<p>
The price a bond is traded for is determined by the present value of the cash flows that remain for the bond. For any given bond, this would be the outstanding coupon repayments and the principal amount. The price of the bond can be influenced by time to maturity, credit quality of the bond issuer, and supply vs demand. 
</p>
<p>
The term to maturity on a bond will tell the investor how long the principal amount is held by the issuer and when the final principal is repaid. As the term to maturity reduces, so do the coupon repayments on the bond and the opportunity cost of leaving capital invested in the bond. As a result, the bond price will move closer to par. Longer maturity dates on a bond will also reduce their price when the yield curve is normal. This is because the longer maturity exposes the bond to more opportunity of default from the bond issuer, and of an interest rate risk, where the opportunity to invest the capital in a savings account will yield greater returns than the bond. You can read my blog about yield curves<a href="https://aneesh.co.uk/an-introduction-to-yield-curves" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Supply and demand reflects upon our discussion earlier, where the demand for a bond will be inversely related to interest rates. Bonds with longer maturities will also be influenced by the yield curve and future expectations for interest rate movements. Supply and demand will have a daily influence on bond price movement in-line with adjustments to the bank rate of the same currency. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the credit quality of a bond issuer will also impact the price of a bond as this can have an influence the future returns of the bond. Bonds with a lower rating will have a lower price to account for the greater possibility of default on the bond than those with higher ratings. This is unrelated to interest rate risk. The lower quality bond ratings will however offer a higher coupon rate to compensate for the higher risk taken by the investor.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Yield to maturity</h4>
<p>
In the next section we will use the term 'Yield to maturity'. Let's look at what this means..
<br>

</p>
<br>
<h4>Measuring interest rate risk</h4>
<p>
The exposure a bond's price has to a change in interest rate is known as a bond's <strong>duration</strong>. 

longer term bonds will have a higher durations. This is because the investor's capital is invested for a longer period of time in the bond. If the opportunity arises where interest rates rise, the investor will not be able to invest their money for greater returns until the bond expires, which is in a longer period of time. Therefore if the investor were to sell their bond to reinvest their capital, the price of the bond would be much lower to account for the opportunity cost to the new buyer of receiving greater returns from the immediate bank rate. 
</p>
<p>
There are two types of measures that are used for Duration. One is Macaulay duration, which takes the average weighted time of a portfolio until which all expected cash flows are returned. This will yield a value in years. The second type of duration is called Modified Duration, which will provide an expected change in a bond's price for a 1% change in interest rate. 
</p>
<h5>Macaulay Duration</h5>
<p>
Macaulay Duration will discount the future cash flows of a bond (the coupon repayments and the principal repayment) to the present value. By definition, this is the Bond's price. The Duration formula will then provide an average time until each of those cash flows will be repaid to the investor, to when they are no longer exposed. 
</p>
<h5>Modified Duration</h5>
<p>
Modified duration will tell the investor how the bond's price will change with a 1% change in interest rate. Modified duration will use Macaulay Duration and divide it by the YTM divided by the number of coupons per year, plus 1.    
</p>
<p>
Using our example, this would be.

<h4>Managing interest rate risk</h4>
<p>
So far we are able to understand how interest rates and bond prices are inversely related, and how the relationship can be quantified for assessment by fund managers. But what can a manager do to mitigate, or manage the exposure their investments have towards a change in interest rate?
</p>
<p>
Some of the strategies we mention below will primarily aim to reduce the duration of a portfolio. Reducing duration means reducing the number of years we are exposed to receiving all the cash flows of our bonds. Some strategies include: holding bonds of different durations and hedging interest rate risk with other derivatives.
</p>
<p>
Buying bonds of different durations.

</p>
<p>
Hedging strategies with derivatives.


</p>
<p>

Duration is about how exposed the locked-in position the investor has with the bond when the 
opportunity of favourable returns arise from the bank rate. 

Lower maturity has lower duration as exposure to the lost gains is reduced. 
Higher coupon rate has lower duration. As the time to repayment is reduced from coupon repayments. 

</p>
<br>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
This blog has looked at why bonds carry interest rate risk, how that risk can be measured with two different formulae, and how a fund manager may mitigate their exposure to interest rate risk.
</p>
<p>
Given the scale and utility of bonds in the market, interest rate risk is a major risk that is faced across financial markets and which is mitigated and managed for on a daily basis. In the current economic climate, where interest rates are forecasted to rise, we will begin to see even more attention applied made on duration, as the value of bonds are threatened by bank rate increases.
