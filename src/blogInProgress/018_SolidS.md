<h4>The SOLID principles of design</h4>
<p>
This blog post will be the first of a series of 5 posts that cover the SOLID principles of design. The SOLID principles were coined by Robert C. Martin in his paper <i>Design Principles and Design Patterns</i>.
The SOLID acronym was later defined by Michael Feathers.
The SOLID principles apply to object orientated programming and encourage the creation of maintainable software that prevents code rot from accumulating. As software applications scale in size, the design principles from SOLID become more and more important to prevent complex issues from arising and to enable a more efficient process for enhancement and bug fixes.
<p>
<p>
The SOLID principles consist of:<br>
S - Single responsibility principle<br>
O - Open-closed principle<br>
L - Liskov substitution principle<br>
I - Interface segregation principle<br>
D - Dependency inversion principle<br>
</p>
<p>
This blog post will focus upon the Single responsibility principle (SRP).
</p>

<br>
<h4>Single responsibility principle</h4>
<p>
The single responsibility principle asserts that any one class must have one single responsibility, and therefore just <strong>one reason to change</strong>.
The SRP ensures that classes contain behaviour they are expected to have and changes to them do not create unrelated behaviour or side effects from a change.
Classes that are designed by the single responsibility principle are described as being cohesive and robust.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Class cohesion and robustness</h4>
<p>
The word <i>cohesion</i> describes the action of formed a united whole. In object orientated programming, classes are cohesive when they can be used together without conflict.
Class cohesion is achieved within object orientated programming through the design and implementation of a class to a single purpose.

<br>
<h4>The benefits of SRP</h4>
<p>
Testing: Single responsibility classes have less testing required as there are fewer variations within the class to perform.

Loose-coupling: classes will have fewer dependencies upon other classes

Debugging: Smaller and well defined classes are easier to search and debug.
