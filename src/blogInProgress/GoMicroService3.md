<h4>Websockets and templating</h4>
<p>
We use websockets for retaining a connection to a server from a client rather than just for a single request.
For example, in a chat room, you would want to retain a GET connection for methods.
In the past, long polling was used for websockets which meant either many empty HTTP requests were sent to empty responses, or when 
responses were made, they were only received when the poll was made.
Therefore websockets resolve the problem as an active listener on the application. 
Other use cases could be stock market applications to obtain a change in price, or a multiplayer game to obtain the latest update from an opponent.]
