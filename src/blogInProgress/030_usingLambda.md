1. Lambda is for functional interfaces
2. introduces functional programming. What is functional programming?
2. In the past we used anonymous classes. therefore boiler plate of class + impl to use interface
3. Lambda removes this boilerplate and allows us to use a function without belonging to a class.
    it is passed around like an object and used on demand
4. Design on a lambda (args -> function)
5. use {} if there is more than 1 method inside
6. when created, it is matched to the abstract method and turned into a function that implements interface
7. Uses type inference from method declaration at compile time to know args provided and return type.
