1. Lambda is for functional interfaces
2. introduces functional programming. What is functional programming?
2. In the past we used anonymous classes. therefore boiler plate of class + impl to use interface
3. Lambda removes this boilerplate and allows us to use a function without belonging to a class.
    it is passed around like an object and used on demand
4. Design on a lambda (args -> function)
5. use {} if there is more than 1 method inside
6. when created, it is matched to the abstract method and turned into a function that implements interface
7. Uses type inference from method declaration at compile time to know args provided and return type.

<h4>Lambda and Functional programming</h4>
<p>
Lambda functions were introduced to Java in Java 8 as a step towards functional programming within Java.
Functional programming enables a developer to pass functions around the application without having to create an Object to which the function belongs. The result, is dynamic and flexible code that can be used to perform algorithms upon inputs with minimalistic code.
</p>
<p>
Lambda functions in Java can be used to reduce the boilerplate code required for a functional interface. A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method. The functional interface will therefore be implemented with a single overridden method.
