<h4>Derivatives</h4>
<p>
Within finance, a derivative is a <u>contract</u> between <u>two parties</u> where the value of the contract is derived from an underlying asset or security. The underlying asset is typically stocks, bonds, currency, commodities or market indexes. 

</p>
<p>

</p>
<br>
<h4>Trading derivatives</h4>
<p>
Derivatives are traded either through an exchange or over the counter (OTC). Exchange traded derivatives are well regulated and therefore have safeguards such as a clearing house to protect the counterparties from counterparty risk, where one party defaults and is unable to retain their side of the agreement. 
</p>
<p>
As deriviatives <i>derive</i> their value from an underlying security, they are known as secondary securities. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Why derivatives are used</h4>
<p>
Derivatives are used for many purposes:
- to hedge a position (offsetting a risk with a second investment). Such as owning stock in a different currency thus exposing them to currency risk. Then taking a derivative in the currency to offset the risk.

- speculation on the direction of an asset movement
- leverage holdings of an asset


</p>

<br>
<h4>Forms of derivatives</h4>
<p>
Derivatives can be divided into two key classes: lock and option. A lock will bind the parties together in a contract where an obligation is made for the transfer of securities at a price. Examples of a lock include a swap, future and forward.
An option, however, offers the right, but not the obligation to the buy or sel the security at a certain price on or before the expiration date. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Futures contracts</strong> is a contract to sell or buy an underlying asset at a certain price in the future. Futures contracts can be valuable to organsations that would like to remove the risk of price rises in a security at a certain point in the future. For example, an airline may take out a futures contract to fix the price of jet fuel they buy in the future. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Forward contracts</strong> are similar to a Futures contract, however they are not traded on an exchange. A forward contract, traded OTC, can be modified to provide bespoke opportunities between the counterparties' terms. By their nature, a forward contract will be more exposed to default risk and are less available to retail investors. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Swap contracts</strong> are an OTC agreement between counterparties to exchange their cash flows over a period of time. The swap contract will be used to hedge against the risk of a cash variable including interest rates or foreign exchange rate. A fixed income stream of capital will be swapped for a variable stream of cash flow based upon the variable rate. 
</p>
<p>Swap contracts are most commonly found as an interest rate swap and a currency swap</p>
<p>
<strong>Option</strong> contracts come in two forms: a put and a call. A put gives the owner of the contract the right to sell the underlying asset at the agreed (strike) price whereas a call will provide the right to buy the underlying asset at the agreed price before the expiration date. 
An option premium is paid for by the owner of the contract to have the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell the securities. Unlike derivatives of the lock class, options do not always provide a mutual benefit and are based upon speculation into the movement in value of the underlying asset.
