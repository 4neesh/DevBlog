<h4>Derivatives</h4>
<p>
Within finance, a derivative is a <u>contract</u> between <u>two parties</u> where the value of the contract is derived from an underlying asset or security. The underlying asset is typically stocks, bonds, currency, commodities or market indexes.

<h4>Trading derivatives</h4>
<p>
Derivatives are traded either through an exchange or over the counter (OTC). Exchange traded derivatives are well regulated and therefore have safeguards such as a clearing house to protect the counterparties from counterparty risk, where one party defaults and is unable to retain their side of the agreement. 

</p>

<br>
<h4>Why derivatives are used</h4>
<p>
Derivatives are used for many purposes:
- to hedge a position (offsetting a risk with a second investment). Such as owning stock in a different currency thus exposing them to currency risk. Then taking a derivative in the currency to offset the risk.

- speculation on the direction of an asset movement
- leverage holdings of an asset
