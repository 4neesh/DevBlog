used efficient frontier portfolio theory (Markowitz) but found it didnt tell much about being uscertain about any of the assumptions (a or b)
continued to make mistakes, build relationships and drive innovation through young staff

it was all about bringing issues  to the surface to address and learn from them together

<h4>Life Principles 1.0</h4>
<p>

embrace reality and deal with it
- problems are seen as a puzzle and solving problems creates new principles to avoid it again. 
challenges are an opportunity to learn

Important to be a hyperrealist to understand realism behind dreams and understanding the influence a cause-effect relationship that is possible to change reality

important to be open-minded and transparent. be clear on what I am doing today and why i am doing it. 
- dont fear critisim and judgement. 
the principle is  to have transparency as an instinct and to be open to it. 

</p>
<p>
it is important to reflect upon pain. if u dont face pain you arent challenging yourself or pushing limits
important to adapt to setback 
ability to adapt aligns to reasoning and perception, not to learning and processing quickly

The internal locus of control - taking ownership of failures ad mistakes and not blame things out of your control
Important to look down on yourself from above and to see the cause effects of relationships with goals and achievement
You are the designer of career and decisions. Take a strategic perspective and look at things objectively. Important not to make emotional decisions
Important to reflect on weaknesses and room for growth
</p>
<p>
Struggle is defined as a part of growth
there are 4 ways we handle struggle and understand out choices
1 - deny struggle 
2- accept weakness and work to improve
3 - work around weakness
4- change the goal

It is also important to reflect upon the nature of goals when considering, there are 5 key decisions:
- don't confuse what i wish to be true with what is true
- don't worry about looking good, focus on the goal
- don't overweight the first order of consequence, focus on 2 and 3
- don't let pain stand in the way of progress (what is pain)
- don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but myself
