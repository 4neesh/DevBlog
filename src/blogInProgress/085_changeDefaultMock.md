<h4>Changing default mock behaviour</h4>
<p>

This video will explore the 3 different ways that a default Mock Object can be returned to the test class from a method call.
By understanding how mock Object behaviour can be changed, we can transform Null Object responses into mocked, Spy or real Object representations. 
As a result, test methods can be more fluent and resistant to empty and null default values.
