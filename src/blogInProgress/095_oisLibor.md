<strong>Key Takeaways</strong><br>
&#8226; Overview of the interbank market and why they exist.<br>
&#8226; Understand the two interest rates of LIBOR and OIS.<br>
&#8226; Understand how the spread between LIBOR and OIS can be a good indicator to the confidence banks have with each other.<br>

<br>
<h4>Interbank markets</h4>
<p>
The interbank market differs from the 'open market' as it only enables specific banks to lend and trade with each other. The interbank market often refers to the interbank foreign exchange (FX) market where currency and currency deriviates are traded. We also have the interbank lending market where short term loans are also traded amongst banks to enable them to better manage their capital reserves and liquidity requirements. This blog will focus on the interbank lending market. 
</p>
<p>
The interbank lending market enables banks to manage their liquidity risk to meet stringent requirements to ensure they are able to withstand any potential 'bank runs' by customers. Alternatively, banks with excess levels of liquidity can lend their reserves to earn an interest income.
</p>
<p>
Why would banks want to lend to each other? Imagine if Bank A has borrowed £10 million pounds from the Bank of England and are paying interest on the loan at the current bank rate of 1%. Bank A will be able to make a nice profit by lending £8 million of that loan to commercial purposes at an interest rate of 2%. But Bank A has not yet found a purpose for the other £2 million on it's books. So rather than letting it sit in the bank earning nothing, they can then lend to other banks in the <i>interbank lending market</i> for a set period of time until they find a more lucrative use for the capital. 
</p> 
<p>
On the other hand, Bank B, which may require extra short-term capital for their own books (perhaps to meet liquidity requirements or to satisfy a new loan opportuntity) are able to borrow capital on the interbank market at a certain interest rate. Bank A and Bank B will agree a certain timeframe for which the money is lent; Bank A is happy as they find a use for their extra £2 million and Bank B is happy because they are able to satisfy their capital requirements. 
</p>
<p>
The banks that are participating in the interbank market tend to be high-credit quality institutions. As the market involves unsecured lending, there is a degree of dependency on each other to repay loans as expected, and at a competitively low interest rate to reflect the high credit-quality of the participants. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>LIBOR</h4>
<p>
LIBOR - The London Interbank Offer Rate is a variable interest rate that is used by banks for short-term, unsecured interbank lending.
</p>
<p>
LIBOR is a globally accepted benchmark and reflects the cost of lending between banks. LIBOR is calculated on the rate that a consortium of banks lend 5 currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY and CHF.
There are 7 different maturities for LIBOR that include: overnight, 1 week and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. Despite there being 35 different LIBOR combinations of currency and maturity, the 3-month USD LIBOR rate is most commonly quoted as the 'current LIBOR rate'.
</p>
<p>
The LIBOR rate is posted on a daily basis. It is calculated by the British Banking Association who ask major global banks what they would charge for short term loans. They then remove the tail-end values and finding the average. This is known as a 'trimmed average'. The daily rate is published by the ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) Benchmark Administration. 
</p>
<p>
The rate that each bank offers for short term lending will change each day to reflect credit risk on the loan. Credit risk is the risk that the original loan amount will not be repaid. As the length of the loan increases, so does (in theory) the credit risk, as there is a longer period of time where the loanee may default and be unable to repay the loan in full. 
</p>
<p>
So why do we care about LIBOR?
</p>
<p>
As a bank customer, you may also be impacted by LIBOR. LIBOR is often used to determine the interest rate on various products such as credit cards, loans and variable-rate mortgages. We will look a little further into why LIBOR matters to connect the dots on how it impacts consumer lending rates. 
LIBOR is important because it also determines the rate that it lends at. It will not charge a mortgage customer less than LIBOR because it will not be able to make a profit. LIBOR is a variable rate, it reflects the confidence that other banks have with each other to borrow and repay capital over specific periods of time. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Overnight Index Swap</h4>
<p>
An 'index swap' refers to a contract where one counterparty agrees to exchange a cash flow on a specified date regarding a specific index. The overnight index swap uses an overnight index such as the Federal Funds rate to perform a swap against. 
</p>
<p>
While LIBOR informs us of the average cost of lending across currencies and maturities, OIS will be reflective of a single central bank. This would be the Fed Fund rate in the US or a target interest rate specified by the central bank. Other overnight interest rates include:<br>
&#8226; SONIA: Sterling Overnight Index Average<br>
&#8226; EONIA: Euro Overnight Index Average<br>
&#8226; SARON: Swiss Average Rate Overnight Index<br>
&#8226; Mutan Rate: Japanese Overnight Index Rate<br>
</p>
<p>
The overnight rate is the interest rate that institutions can borrow or lend at in the overnight market. The rate is specified in the monetary policy of the central bank. The market is called the 'overnight' market because it is used by banks at the end of the day to meet liquidity requirements. Unlike LIBOR, OIS only has 1 maturity: overnight, and therefore further maturities can be derived by compounding the rate. As overnight rates are reflective of the nations central bank, it can be seen as useful indicator of the cost of borrowing. 
</p>
<p>
The OIS is used by banks to exchange the floating OIS from the central bank for a fixed interest rate charge. This enables them to hedge against the risk of the overnight interest rate from changing.
</p>
<br>
<h4>LIBOR vs OIS</h4>
<p>
The key difference between LIBOR and OIS lies in the credit risk they hold. LIBOR rates reflect the credit and liquidity risk of the market as they will want to lend at rates that reflect the perceived risk in the banking market. 
LIBOR involves lending capital to another bank for an extended period of time. As the maturity of the loan becomes greater, the credit risk on the loan increases as the opportunity for the counterparty to default (although small) increases. 
The difference however with OIS is that credit risk is <i>virtually</i> eliminated. Capital is lent overnight. You can compound the OIS to achieve similar maturities to LIBOR by compounding the rate over the same number of days. Just as LIBOR is floating, so is OIS. Therefore you cannot simply take out compounded OIS loans over a month and lend out at LIBOR for an arbitrage profit. If the OIS rate increases within that month, the loans you make overnight will begin to cost more, and may create a loss compared to a fixed LIBOR loan over the same one month period. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>Why Arbitrage may not exist</h4>
<p>
For example, at the time of writing this, LIBOR 3 month USD is 1.50643% (<a href="https://www.global-rates.com/en/interest-rates/libor/libor.aspx">here</a>) and OIS is 0.83% (<a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/overnight_federal_funds_rate_market_daily#:~:text=Overnight%20Federal%20Funds%20Rate%20is,long%20term%20average%20of%204.62%25.">here</a>). You may think (provided you are a bank) that you can simply borrow overnight at 0.83% for 90 consecutive days and lend within the interbank market with a 3-month LIBOR loan. The problem you may face is that OIS is floating, and may rise, and you could very easily begin paying more for the loan than what is being lent at. On the 15th March OIS was 0.08%, and on the 22nd March it was 0.33% and today (17th May) it is 0.83%. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>The LIBOR OIS Spread</h4>
<p>
The LIBOR-OIS (also known as LOIS) spread is a fixed-floating spread that compares both the floating rate of LIBOR for a given maturity, and how it compares with the fixed OIS rate compounded to the same maturity. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, the LIBOR-OIS spread represents the rate of interest that is required within the interbank market to compensate for the perceived credit risk with taking LIBOR. As a result, we can use the LOIS to gather an understanding for how banks see credit risk in the interbank market. 
</p>
<p>
You can find the historical LOIS spread <a href="https://www.icmagroup.org/market-practice-and-regulatory-policy/repo-and-collateral-markets/market-data/libor-ois-spreads-lois/">here</a>. Notice in March 2020 there had been a huge spike in the spread. A possible cause for this may be the outbreak of Covid-19 and the global lockdown that subsequently followed. A similar spike occurred in 2008 prior to the financial crisis. LOIS can considered a valuable indicator to the perception of credit risk within the interbank market. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>LIBOR scandal</h4>
<p>
Earlier in the blog, we mentioned how LIBOR was calculated, and how it had been (in theory) a competitive rate set by specific banks that were averaged out by the British Bankers Association. Unfortunately, this 'competitive' submitted by the banks were not always done so with the purest of intentions. LIBOR is incredibly powerful in the global market as it influences the rate which you can take a mortgage out upon, and which you can deposit money into a bank to return on. 
</p>
<p>
One assumption made within an investment bank is the presence of a 'Chinese wall'. This is a theoretical wall that prevents communication between different divisions of the bank that may have an influence on each other. For example, between the parts of the bank that submit their LIBOR rates to the BBA, and the traders whose derivatives have exposures on LIBOR. This may not have been followed so well with certain banks. 
</p>
<p>
If the LIBOR submitters for a bank are aware that a specifically higher or lower LIBOR can benefit the net position of their traders, they may be motivated to post artificially high or low LIBOR rates to the BBA. It is also believed that up to 20 banks colluded to submitting LIBOR rates that were not strictly competitive to benefit their positions. 
</p>
<p>
A further drive behind collusion in submitting LIBOR rates that were not competitive were to give a false premise for the banks position to borrow and lend in the market. If a bank considered themselves riskier to lend to, they may reduce the LIBOR rate thay they think they can lend and borrow at. As a result the LIBOR rate for the day may be reduced thus benefiting the bank that submitted a lower rate. 
</p>
<p>
In 2012, a scandal involving LIBOR was highly publicised following the collusion of multiple large banks to fix the LIBOR rate. 
As we understand, LIBOR is the average of the rates submitted by banks that they are willing to lend at. This trust had been abused where traders from major banks provided artificially high or low rates to support their own derivative positions and activity.  
</p>
<p>
In the aftermath of the scandal, believed to have started since 2003, LIBOR is currently being phased out, expected to be completed by June 30 2023. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
The interbank lending market enables banks to more efficiently allocate and obtain capital dependening on whether they hold excess amounts or require it for short-term unsecured borrowing. LIBOR is a variable interest rate that determines the rate which banks can lend to each other in 35 different currency/maturity combinations. 
<br>
OIS is a rate used by banks to borrow overnight, and therefore greately reduces the presence of credit risk in the transaction.
<br>
The LIBOR-OIS spread is a useful indicator to summarise the confidence banks have in lending to each other as it reflects the credit risk they perceive for longer term loans.
