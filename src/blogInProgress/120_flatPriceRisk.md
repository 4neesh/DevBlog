if a company agrees to future sales, at a fixed price, it exposes itself to the risk that metal input costs rise

Physical hedging involves the pricing of bought or sold physical material to match the pricing of future production and sales. This is called “back-to-back” pricing

Financial hedging is the action of managing price risk by using a financial derivative (like a future or an option) to offset the price movement of a related physical transaction

Ways to hedge:
Buy metal in the spot market, where you take delivery almost immediately. This may not be ideal, as it leaves ABC Corp with large inventories and the associated costsof financing, storing and insuring.

Create a fixed-price agreement with a physical aluminium supplier for delivery in the future. This may also not be the best solution as physical suppliers may charge more for assuming the price risk. Furthermore, physical fixed-price delivery agreements are subject to the risk that a supplier does not honour the agreement (performance risk) if market prices move too much in favour of ABC Corp.


that a financial hedge is a method by which price risk in a physical contract can be offset by opening a contra-position in a financial derivative

The financial hedge graph illustrates how a change in the LME Aluminium price affects ABC Corp’s profit and loss from the financial hedge. The financial hedge can be bought (paying the fixed price), which protects buyers of metal against rising prices, or sold (receiving the fixed price), which protects sellers of metal against falling prices.

Commodities Demystified
Flat price expsure - the risk of a change in the benchmark price for a barrel off oil or tonne of copper concentrate.
So on the transaction date, the parties agree both trades at fixed margins against a benchmark index price. 
Physical price and futures prices dont stay completely aligned, leaving a more manageable market risk, known as basis risk 
Basis risk is the difference in the price behaviour between the physical commodity and the hedging instrument
Basis risk arises because, in practice, the price behaviour of a hedging instrument will never exactly correspond to that of the physical commodity.

The problem of widespread basis and flat price risk in agricultural commodity markets

Basis is commonly understood as the differnece between a cash-market price and the corresponding futures market price. 
Within the agricultureal commodities space, market can operate without any form of liquid futures market leading to flat price risk. 

Basis risk can arise within agricultural markets from 4 differnet sources. 
1. product quality basis from differences in grade, quality or other standardized contract spec
2. calendar basis risk, when delivery date of trade differs from the expiration of the futures marketcontract
3. location basis where the point of sale differs from delivery point, resulting in logistical costs. 
4. Price basis risk when a cash price does not move in conjucnction with the correspondin g futures market price, when there is a difference of information flow or price reporting ffrequency for example

The variety of commodity products make having hedging options available are limited. 
This means investors can be exposed to the absolute price of a commodity, known as flat price risk. 
There can also be obstacles like lack of product standardisation and storage restrictions.
