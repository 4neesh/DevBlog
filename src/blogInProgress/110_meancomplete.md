<h4>Create a MEAN Application</h4>
<p>
Build a full-stack mean application from scratch, step-by-step with this video!
We will create a web application that can be used for storing, updating and deleting diary entries.
This application will use Angular (and bootstrap) for the front-end, node and express JS for the backend server, and mongo db for data persistence!
