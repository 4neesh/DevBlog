<strong>Key Takeaways</strong><br>
&#8226; What is basis risk and how it came about.<br>
&#8226; Why banks care about basis risk.<br>

<br>
<p>
In this blog, I will take a look at how Basis risk can arise and its relationship to a futures contract.
</p>

<br>
<h4>The futures contract</h4>
<p>
A futures contract is a derivative that is traded between two counterparties as agreement to buy or sell an underlying commodity, asset or security at a certain price at a certain point in time. The futures contract is traded
through a futures exchange, and not to be confused with a forward contract which is similar to a futures, but traded over the counter, without an exchange.<br>
The futures contract serves two purposes:
</p>
<p>
First, the counterparty that sells the contract are acknowledging the fact that they have a guaranteed sale for a certain amount of their asset at a certain price at a point in the future.<br>
Second, the counterparty buying the contract are acknowledging the fact that they have a guaranteed price which they will pay for a certain amount of an asset at a point in the future.<br>
The time which the exchange happens is known as the <strong>maturity date</strong>. The buyer of the futures contract is therefore
hedging the risk that the price will drastically increase from when the futures contract is agreed upon, and the maturity date, thus protecting themselves from <strong>price risk</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Futures contracts can also be used for speculation. For example if an investor believes the price of an asset may rise, they can purchase a futures contract to buy the asset at a cheaper price than they expect it to rise to, and then can make subsequent profits from the resale of the asset in the market. 
</p>
<p>
How are futures used in the real world?<br>
A common example I refer to would be any airline company that would like to ensure the price of their jet fuel is secured for the immediate and long-term future. By using a futures contract, they can 
better estimate their cash requirements and costs for flights in the future. A rather interesting example might also be when McDonalds benefitted from a futures contracts that enabled them to create the chicken
nugget. You can read the story <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-mcnugget-launch-was-masterminded-by-bridgewater-ray-dalio-2018-4?r=US&IR=T">here</a>.
</p>

<br>
<h4>The price of a future</h4>
<p>
The agreed upon price within the futures contact will reflect upon the speculation each counterparty has on the future price of the underlying asset. 
For example, if a shop owner expects the price of milk to rise from £1 per gallon to £2 per gallon 6 months in the future, they may like to buy a futures contract to ensure that 
they can buy the milk for £1.50 per gallon 6 months from today. The price agreed on the future will remove the price risk the shop owner farmer faces, however this risk is replaced by <strong>basis risk</strong>. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Basis Risk</h4>
<p>
Basis risk exists as the price difference between the current price of the underlying asset/security and the price that is agreed upon in the futures contract. Basis risk is therefore a replacement of
price risk as it hedges the investor from the absolute price movement of the asset.
</p>
<p>
Using the example of the shop owner who uses a futures contract to hedge against the upward movement of the price of milk, the basis risk the shop owner faces is equal to the price agreed within the futures contract 
and the current price of the asset. This would be 50 pence as £1.50 - £1.00 = £0.50. 
</p>
<p>
The price agreed on the futures exchange will become closer and closer to the actual price of the asset as the time to maturity for the exchange is shorter and shorter. As time passes, the movement of the 
futures price and the underlying asset can however change. For example, the price of milk may rise to £1.60, therefore the basis risk to the shop owner will actually be -10 pence. What we can see here, is that 
basis risk can actually be positive and negative as the price of the asset changes. As the underlying asset price moves, so do the price of futures contract for the same maturity date that the shop owner had initially agreed upon.
</p>
<p>
If our shop owner agreed to exchange 6 months from today, which is 1st November 2021, and by October 1st 2021 the price of milk is now £1.60, then the futures price for November 2021 is likely to be higher than £1.50 (for those wishing to buy a 1 month maturity future).
</p>
<p>
The price movements between the underlying asset and the futures market are not always perfectly correlated. There are many factors to consider for a futures contract such as the cost of storing the asset, delivery of the asset and the risk-free rate of return that can all impact it. As a result, the basis risk, which is the difference between the price today for the asset and the agreed futures price, can grow and shrink as the markets for the asset and its future move in an uncorrelated fashion. In an ideal world for the shop owner, the price of the milk and the futures price will be well correlated such that basis risk is nil at maturity. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>Placing investments and hedging risk</h4>
<p>
When a financial institution engage in an investment, they are taking a position whereby they expect a return for their investment, however on the contrary are willing to accept a level of risk that the return may not be fully delivered. The possibility for lower than expected returns can be captured as the risk of the investment. 
</p>
<p>
Risk with any investment can come in a number of sizes and categories; for example: market risk from the economic impacts of the entire market, liquidity risk from not having the capital to use for other purposes, credit risk, that the company will be unable to repay the interest on your investment, such as for bonds. 
</p>
<p>
The collective risks that are faced by the investment are forecasted and either accepted by the institution, or reduced through hedging.

</p>
<br>
<h4>Spot prices vs Futures prices</h4>
<p>
To understand how basis risk is calculated, we need to understand the difference between a spot price and a futures price. 
A spot price, is the price paid for an investment/security/anything at a given time. For example, when you go shopping at a supermarket, you're in theory paying the spot price for your groceries. 
A futures price is the price for an asset to be delivered in the future. 
For example, a spot price for a StockA might be £2.00 today, but a futures price for it might be £2.03 to be delivered in 5 weeks time. One security can have many different futures prices for it as the time-frame for when the security will be delivered will be different. 
</p>
<p>
The spot price is equal to the futures price is the time on the futures contract is 0. If it is not, then an opportunity for arbitrage arises. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Using a futures contract</h4>
<p>
The basis risk for any security can be derived from the difference between its spot price and its future price.
So how do we hedge against the different price of the asset and the future?
The hedge for the future price of an asset can be used with the futures contract. 
Buying a futures contract will secure the price of the asset to be delivered/bought in the future. 
If you are selling a product, you would be naturally long in the market, so the price risk can be hedged with a short position. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>The basis risk</h4>
<p>
In the ideal world, the price of the futures contract bought will be equal to what is expected in the future. 
However the future market is not predictable and the price of the future contract can change. 
The challenges in finding a perfect futures contract is due to having a futures for different underlying assets, or a different futures maturity date. 
The underlying asset may be priced differently
the time horizon not at maturity may be trading at a discount or premium. Only at maturity are the prices of spot and futures convergent.
