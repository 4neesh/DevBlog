<h4>Introduction</h4>

What are petrochemicals?
- A barrel can be split into crude oil, natural gas, coal, salt and ore. The main ones are crude oil and natural gas. 
- We have aromatics that consist of Xylene and Bentene, and Olefins, that consist of Butadene, Propylene, Ethylene
- Crude oil is refined into Gas Oil and Naptha that leads to Aromatics and Olefins

<h4>Crude Oil refineries</h4>
<p>
- configured to produce fuels and petchem fuels
- crude refineries make profit on crude flexibility
- petchem refineries make profit on feed flexibility

When we consider crude oil, there are different ways that the refineries will compete to product different products. 
Natural gas will use gas processing and fractionation to create Ethane, Propane and Butance. These are then turned into Ethylene, Propylene and Butadiene (Olefins).
Using a Steam Cracker, the EPB can be converted into Benzene, Toluene, Xylenes (BTX) using a BTX Extraction. These are aromatics.
More than natural gas goes into the BTX Extraction, it also comes from Coal, which are obtained from steel mills and a coke oven, but more from Crude Oil which uses an oil refinery to create Naptha. This will use a Roformate to be sent for BTX extraction or is sent to a gasoline pool.

Aramco:
commercialise crude to chem technilogies. aim is to reduce cost of chemicals while lowering carbon footprint

Crude oil is a primary source of energy 
Oil reining, which is converting crude to gasoline, diesel and fuel oil (all 3 are transport fuels) accounts for 50% share of products from refineries 
Therefore demand of transportation fuel can dictate spreads for refineries 

Challenges faced by refineries
- pressure for cleaner-burning fuelds from regulation and environmental awareness, such as high sulfer fuel oil is low in demand, meaning refineries look to new markets for HSFO
- plateau in fuel oil demand, expected by 2030 duue to EVs. Therefore refiners need to explore ways to maintain level of yield on crude oil
[add diagram of petchems growth]

Petchem accounts for 14% of oil and 8% of gas demand. the petchem segments is expected to grwo fdue to higher demand for plastics from developing countries. 
Yield of petchem feedstock depends on complxity of refining, this is a 17.2% atm but will be 40%

Refineries had previously been set-up to produce transportation fuels. COTC will change this to create high value chemical products.
At the moment 10% of the barrel can be used to produce chemical feedstock, thuus can be changed to 70-80%

COTC currently planned in construction in china and the middle east. It is focussed on yield in light olefins or aromatics. Such as benzene, iolene and xylene. 

Strategies
- steam cracking for ethylene, propylene, naptha, gas oil, ethance. This involves preconditioned crude oil fed into a steam cracker
- hydroo processing, deasphalting and steam cracking

McKinsey
gasoline is expected to experience the greatest fall in demand as it is used by light-duty passenger vehicles.
major oil derived petchems are ethane, ipg, naptha. these are used in production of polymers for plastics and synthetic fibers and more. Driven by demand from global wealth.
Refineries are facing challenges to reduce output of diesels, less gasoline and more jet fueld and petchem feedstock
Refiners around the world must plan now given time is takes to change and the capital expenditure expectation.
the approach to refineries to change can be in a different ways
1. fluid catalytic cracking. Converts vacuum gasoil into gasoline. FCC gasoline cracking naptha and aromatic materials that can be separated out also includes olefins
2. High severity FCC
- used to optimise propylene yield. Allows refiners to convert heavy oils into high value products for integrated processes
3. FCC to steam cracking
- maximise monomer output with catalyitc cracking. 
- expected to yield 70%. Petchems of ethylene, propylene, bezelene, toluene, xylene

New Refinery Configurations
- how refiners can change product yield by changing the mix and arrangement of refining process units
1. increaased hydrocracking. Hydrocracking compete with FCC for deestock. HC yield is more higher quality deiseld, jet fueld, LPG and naptha
This shift to HC will increase Naptha output
2. maximse aromatics reforming
