<h4>Eureka Server</h4>
<p>

It allows you to enable microservices to see each other, to register and be discoverable.
Other microservices are discoverable by the server by registering it. In this blog I will create the discovery server. 
The discovery server sits centralised to the other clients to enable the consumption of services without necessarily knowing their location. In this way, the discovery server is a broker to clients. 
If the location of a client changes, the consumers will not need to know as the server will re-route the clients. 

Eureka provides the host name and port to the clients.

<h4>Creating the configuration server</h4>
<p>
Add @EnableEurekaServer to the main class of the service.
