<h4>An asset repurchase agreement</h4>
<p>
I originally expected this blog to be fairly short; while the Repo market is worth trillions of dollars in a global market, it is a fairly simple concept (as we will later see). However the importance of Repos as the 'pipelines of the global financial system' will take this blog through a more interesting turn into understanding fiscal monetary policy and how a government can shape the behaviour of the financial markets, but more worryingly, how the opposite can also occur.
</p>

<br>
<h4>What is a Repo?</h4>
<p>
The term 'Repo' is short for repurchase agreement. A repurchase agreement is commonly referred to as a 'pawn shop' for banks, but I don't really understand it that way, perhaps it's the wording..
</p>
<p>
A repurchase agreement is used by banks to trade debt for cash. So with this in mind, banks <u>need</u> cash and are happy to trade their debt for it. Repurchase agreements are typically traded on an exchange, so let's look at an example: <br>
Bank A holds a government bond, Bond A, but needs to raise some short term capital for it's own purposes. One way a bank can do this is by selling Bond A on the market, but what if Bank A would also like to keep Bond A in its portfolio for a longer term? Well, Bank A can sell Bond A and then repurchase it after the short-term capital requirement is satisfied.
</p>
On the other hand, Bank B has excess capital sitting in its reserves, and would like to make a return on that capital rather than have it sit there earning nothing. Let's take a look at how Bank A and Bank B can create a nice agreement:<br>
Bank A sells Bond A to Bank B. Bank B transfers cash to Bank A and receives Bond A for £100. Bank A only needs the £100 cash overnight, so they agree Bank B to sell Bond A back to Bank A the next day. Bank B will sell this bond for £101 to realise a £1 profit. Bank A is satisfied that they have ultimately obtained their £100 capital for a cost of £1. 
</p>
<p>
What we have is a repurchase agreement; a short term <i>collateralised</i> loan between two banks. The loan is collateralised because Bank B is effectively lending Bank A the money they require, and in-turn receive Bond A as collateral. If Bank A is unable to repurchase Bond A (and thus default on the repo), Bank B is't facing a heavy risk as they can simply liquidate Bond A. 
</p>
<p>
The percentage difference between the price Bond A is sold for and the price Bond A is repurchased for is known as the <strong>repo rate</strong>. In our case, Bond A is sold for £100 and bought back for £101, creating a repo rate of 1%. As a repo is effectively a return on a low-risk short term collateralised loan, a repo rate can be considered a proxy for an overnight risk-free loan.

<h4>The Reverse Repo</h4>
<p>
a reverse repo is where you are sitting on the other side and are sell a security to a ctpy and agree to repurchae at a  lower price. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Benefits of a Repo</h4>
<p>
benefit of a repo
allows companies to satisfy cash shortfalls with securities
if you have too much cash, it is basd and doesnt earn interst. it is only useful for day to day activities
therefore if yhey need cash they can just use a repo to get it.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Repo Haircuts</h4>
<p>
Haircuts exist on the securities where they are posted to a higher value than the cash to account for volatility of the underlying. In case it rises or falls in value. 
In a repo exchange the secutiy may have volatility that means it falls below value of the loan. This ensures the loan is fully collateralised.

105 Lehman 
Lehman realised they could publihs a 5% haircut and treat the repo as a sale, not a repo. This changed their balance sheet and made accountants happy. 
</p>


<br>
<h4>Repos and monetary policy</h4>
<p>
So far we understand that repos are used by banks to control their cash balances, and that they typically hold high-grade debt instruments that are traded as collateral to the short term loan. The instruments traded are typically governement debt as the debt will hold it's value in turbulent markets and therefore requries less of a haircut on the trade.
</p>
<p>
The functionality of government debt in the financial market enables governments to influence the behaviours of banks. For example, a governemnt can issue new debt into the market that can then be used for repos by banks. By issuing new debt into the market, banks are able to directly buy more debt for a return for their excessive cash holdings. Issuing new debt can therefore drain cash reserves from the financial markets as banks buy more governement debt with their cash for an improved return. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly, governments are able to inject capital into the financial market by buying back their debt from banks in place of capital. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Bank reserves</h4>
<p>
Bank reserves refer to the amount of cash they hold, that is readily available. 
Governments impose a minimum level of cash reserves as a target for banks. 
</p>



<br>
<h4>September 2019</h4>
<p>
In septemebr 2019 the repo rate spiked to as high as 10%. 
even with this, banks with excess cash refused to lend 
Strange as repo rate should equal OIS rate
Rate rise was driven by 2 key items: 
quarterly corporate teaxes were due to raise demand for cash
settlement date for previous treasury securities were due. So this mean more cash was outflowing as they had to purchase the securities. So cash was reduced on balance sheets in future.
Cash reserves went from the banks to the governement due to the 2 items above. 

So why was it so volatile?
Prior to 2008, banks had a 'scarce reserves' framework where they held only enough reserves needed. 
From 2008 to 2014 there was a lot of Quantitative easing. 
This meant the federal reserve would buy a lot of treasuries and inject cash into the financial markets. Banks now had 'ample reserves' on their balance sheet.
