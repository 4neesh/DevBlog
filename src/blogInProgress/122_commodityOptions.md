&#8226; Understand the various roles financial institutions play with commodities.<br>

<h4> Derivatives</h4>
<p>
My previous blog took at a look at forwards and swap derivatives in general with an application to commodity derivatives. This blog will look at the different flavours and strategies of option derivatives we have with commodities. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>An Option contract</h4>
<p>
If we look back at the forward contract, we have a buyer and seller of the contract. Upon agreement, the buyer will have an obligation to purchase the exact amount of the commodity upon maturity. While this doesn't often happen, and the contract will simply be marked to market with a difference between the futures rate and the market price being paid to the appropriate counterparty at maturity, there remains an outstanding obligation for the contract to be exercised. An options derivative differs as there is no such obligation. A common definition you will see for an option is:<br>
<i>An option provides the right, but not the obligation, to exercise a contract upon expiry.</i>
</p>
<br>
<h4>Options</h4>
<p>
An option contract works as such: <br>
1. The contract is purchased by the buyer from the seller for a fee. <br>
2. The contract will specify which asset can be bought, for a price and volume. <br>
3. The contract will have a maturity date, and depending on the type of contract it is (I will come onto this), the buyer can then exercise the contract if they are 'in the money'
</p>
<p>
The options contract has a few variables to the buyer, so let's take a look at these:<br>
1. If the contract is to purchase a security, it is known as a 'call' option. If it is to sell a security, it is known as a 'put' option.<br>
2. A 'European' option will only allow the buyer of the option to exercise it at maturity, whereas an american option will allow the buyer to exercise at anytime until maturity. Lastly, a Bermudan option will allow the holder to exercise at a set of pre-agreed dates (such as the 28th of each month). <br>
</p>
<p>
Throughout the life of an option contract, it will dip and rise in intrinsic value to the holder as the market price of the underlying security changes. For example for a call option, if the price of the security increases beyond the call price, the option holder can exercise it (if it is American) to make a profit, by buying at the lower market price (also given the fee they paid for the option is less than the difference in prices x volume). For a put option, the option holder will be able to make money if the value of the security drops, as they are able to then sell the security for a price that is higher than the market price. For both of these scenarios, the option holder are considered 'in the money', where they can profit from exercising their right on the option.
