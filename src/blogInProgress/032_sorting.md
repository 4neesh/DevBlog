<h4>Sorting in Java</h4>
<p>


</p>
<br>
<h4>Merge sort</h4>
<p>


</p>

<br>
<h4>Bubble sort</h4>
<p>


</p>

<br>
<h4>Quick sort</h4>
<p>
Similar to merge sort, quick sort uses the divide and conquer technique to break down the collection to sort. The quick is implemented by consistently taking the first, last, or middle element and partitioning all the other elements around it. By breaking down the collection against the element, the collection is split. This process is repeatedly applied until there are no further divisions to be made against the collection.
