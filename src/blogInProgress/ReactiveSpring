why reactive spring
- making organisations go faster
- moving software to prod more efficiently
- its about improving communication structures (conways law)
- optimize for communication in the organisation (reverse conway)
- small teams of independently deployable code to enable accelerated autonomy
- better feedback loops within microservices
- reactive programming is about achieving independent efficiency

Use case of spring
- Resource use (threads) are recycled better with microservices
- Resilience for communication to work together
- Composition: composing streams of systems together. Integrate APIs (Kafka, HTTP, Rabbit)
- Reactive programming is a grand view of the above. 

- Dont use Java 8
- not as secure of useful than 11
