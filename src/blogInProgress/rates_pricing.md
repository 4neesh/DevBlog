<h4>Pricing a bond</h4>
<p>
We use pricing on bonds to find a fair value of them in the market.
Pricing a bond consists of calculating the value of the bonds future cash flow and the value upon maturity (face value).
A <u>rate of return</u> is defined for the bond to determine if the investment in the bond is worthwhile.

</p>
<p>
Before we look deeper on the price valuation of a bond, there are a few definitions to clear:
Coupon rate: The interest return on the investment paid each year until maturity.
Maturity rate: The date at which the face value of the bond is repaid. Face value is not always equal to the amount invested.
Current price: The price of the bond with reference to the interest rate. As interest rates rise, the current price will decrease as the bond is seen as less valuable to buy compared to interest rate.
</p>
<p>
The price of a bond is reflected by its yield to maturity. The yield to maturity of a bond is represented by the coupon returns each year multiplied by a discount rate of the expected interest return. 
Using the same yield curve, we are able to determine the face value of what is returned at the value today. If interest rates is 3%, in 2 years time, the face value will be worth what is paid and today it will be less (as it accumulates value from 3% year year).
The price of the coupons however increase as we understand they can be reinvested to return more. 
The face value divided by the compounded interest payments can be used to calcuate the price of a zero-coupon bond. These are usually traded below par price to the face value to hedge against interest rates. 
</p>

<h4>Yield curves</h4>
<p>
A yield curve is used to benchmark the return on interest for business lending. 
A yield curve is used to plot the interest rate of a bond of equal risk (credit worthiness), but with different maturities.
A normal yield curve will look as so:

Where the  longer the term of the maturity, the higher the yield (return on interest). This suggests risks with time. 

A flat yield curve means investors expect the interest rates to remain the same 

An inverted curve, where short term interest is greater than long term interest shows an expectation that the short term rates to decrease.

The yield curve is an indicator of expectations. 
The yield curve also used to suggest inflation rates and the long-term prediction of the economy. 
The yield curve is used as a benchmark for debt within the market such as lending rates. It predicts output in the economy and growth. 

</p>
<p>
The yield curve is an illustration of the relationship between interest rates and bond yield for treasury bills and bonds. 
</p>
<p>
By understanding the relationship between a yield curve and a bond price, we can further understand <i>yield curve risk</i> that is exposed to a bond's price.
When the interest rates change, the yield curve will shift. If interest rates fall, the curve will become more inverse, thus reducing the cash flow from the coupons and reducing the value of the bond.
The relationship between interest rates and bonds expose the bond to an <i>interest rate risk</i>. Portfolios of assets will therefore use the duration of a fixed income instrument to understand the exposure of the
bond to change in interest rate. The convexity captures the underestimations and overestimations of price increases and decreases respectively from the duration. Duration is a straight-line tangent that is better
reflected as a curve. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>Duration and Convexity</h4>
<p>
The price of a bond is used by the market to value the expected returns of the bond. We have been able to establish the relationship of interest rates to the value of a bond. 
This poses the question of how bonds price are exposed (or at risk) to interest rates.<br>
Duration and convexity are two measures used by Fixed income teams to understand the exposure of a bond to interest rates. Duration is used to understand the sensitivity of a bond's price to a
change in interest rate, whereas convexity reflects the interaction of a bond's price and the yield to changes in interest rate.

<h4>Pricing Options and Swaps</h4>
<p>
Swaps have two numerical expressions that depict their consumption: a price and a value. 
The price reflects the inital term between the counterparties for the swap at the beginning of its life.
The value of the swap reflects the market value of the swap during its life.
</p>

<h4>Pricing derivatives: The Greeks</h4>
<p>
The greeks are used in mathematical finance for representing the sensitivity of a derivative to external factors. 
The Greeks are: Delta, Vega, Theta, Rho, Lambda, Epsilon.
The Greeks are used by derivative traders to understand the exposures of their portfolios to various changes in market conditions
market return = beta
alpha comes from betting against others

</p>
<p>
<strong>Delta</strong> represents the change in a securities price.
<strong>Gamma</strong> represents the rate of change in Delta.
<strong>Vega</strong> 
<strong>Theta</strong>
