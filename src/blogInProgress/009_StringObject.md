<strong>Key Takeaways</strong><br>
&#8226; String literals are stored within a dedicated storage area within the heap.<br>
&#8226; String instances can be compared in different ways.<br>
&#8226; The StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes offer methods that allow the developer to modify Strings as a mutable Object.<br>

<br>
<h4>Introduction to java.lang.String</h4>
<p>
The String class is used in Java to create String Objects; each String Object is immutable and final, and therefore thread-safe. The following code snippet demonstrates how a String can be instantiated with the 'new' operator or as a literal:
</p>

```java{numberLines:true}
String stringOne = new String("Hello");
String stringTwo = "World";

```
<p>
The String Object is stored differently within memory depending on how it is instantiated. The 'new' operator will assign the String into the heap memory, the literal String, however, will be assigned into the <i>String pool</i>.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>String pool</strong><br>
The String pool is a dedicated area within the heap memory for storing String Objects. The String pool is used to assign and obtain String memory addresses when a literal is created. Before a String literal is created, the JVM will scan the String pool to check if the String value already exists; if the String already exists within the String pool, the String literal will point to the String Object within the String pool.<br>
The String pool is demonstrated using the below example:<br>

</p>

```java{numberLines:true}
String stringOne = new String("Hello");
String stringTwo = "World";
String stringThree = "World";

```
<p>
&#8226; When <code language="java">stringOne</code> is created, the String Object is created in the heap space.<br>
&#8226; When <code language="java">stringTwo</code> is created, the String is assigned to the String pool.<br>
&#8226; When <code language="java">stringThree</code> is created, the literal will point the existing String in the String pool.

</p>

<h4>Interning Strings</h4>
<p>
<code language="java">intern()</code> is a public method of the String class that is used to assign a String Object into the String pool. All literal instantiations of a String object call the intern() method by default. When a String is created with the 'new' operator, the intern() method is not called and the String is only stored in the heap. Calling <code language="java">intern()</code> on a String Object that is instantiated with the 'new' operator will provide <strong>additional</strong> storage of the String in the String pool as well as the heap. As a result, two String can be compared using the <code language="java">==</code> operator as opposed to the <code language="java">.equals()</code> method which saves time in testing.<br>
The below example demonstrates the use of <code language="java">intern()</code>: <br>
&#8226; stringOne is created once: in heap memory<br>
&#8226; stringTwo is created twice: in the heap and String pool.<br>
</p>

```java{numberLines:true}
String stringOne = new String("Hello");
String stringTwo = new String("World").intern();

```

<h4>Comparing Strings</h4>
<p>
String objects can be compared with either <code language="java">==</code> or <code language="java">.equals()</code>. <code language="java">==</code> will compare the memory locations of the two Strings, whereas <code language="java">.equals()</code> will compare the value of the Strings. 
The motivation for using the <code language="java">intern()</code> method, therefore, would be to ensure the <code language="java">==</code> comparator will return true when a new String Object is compared with any kind of String literal with the same value. The code sample below demonstrates how different String Objects can be compared and evaluated based upon their memory address and value:
</p>

```java{numberLines:true}

String stringOne = "Hello";
String stringTwo = new String("Hello");
String stringThree = new String("Hello").intern();

System.out.println(stringOne == stringTwo);         //false
System.out.println(stringOne == stringThree);       //true
System.out.println(stringOne.equals(stringTwo));    //true
System.out.println(stringOne.equals(stringThree));  //true
System.out.println(stringTwo == stringThree);       //false

```

<h4>StringBuffer and StringBuilder</h4>
<p>
The StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes provide different implementations for using Strings within an application. The StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes create a mutable String Object stored in the heap memory to be 
</p>
<p>
<strong>StringBuffer</strong> is a mutable Object. When a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. When a StringBuffer Object is created, its value can be changed. 
<br>
<strong>StringBuilder</strong> Objects are identical to StringBuffer except they are not thread-safe. The StringBuilder Object can be accessed simultaneously by different threads, which can create a performance enhancement at the potential cost of data integrity.
</p>
<p>
Both Objects are created in the heap memory and provide functions that enable a String to be manipulated and accessed in memory:<br>
&#8226; <code language="java">append(String)</code> to concatenate String Objects onto the StringBuffer/Builder<br>
&#8226; <code language="java">insert(int, String)</code> to insert the specified String within the StringBuffer/Builder at the <code language="java">int</code> position.<br>
&#8226; <code language="java">reverse()</code> to reverse a String.<br>
&#8226; <code language="java">delete(int, int)</code> to delete the characters from the start and end index defined by the two arguments.<br>
An additional benefit is that their use can resemble a builder pattern to enhance code readability:
</p>

```java{numberLines:true}
    public void createString(stringArg){
    
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        sb.append(stringArg);           //add argument to sb
        sb.insert(3,"__");       //add "__" at third position
        sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length()-1); //remove the final char
        return sb.toString();           //return as a String object

    }

```


<br>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
The String class in unique in its accessibility, comparability, and memory consumption. The JVM is optimized to store String Objects in an efficient manner, however
