<h4>IntelliJ Navigation</h4>
<p>
Discover keyboard shortcuts that can help you to find specific files, methods, classes and instances across your application with higher efficiency with IntelliJ. 
IntelliJ offers different ways that we can instantly specify where we would like to search and what type of item we are looking for (whether it be a class, file, method, variable and so on.)
Lastly, we will look at how you can control-click your way around an application to see where methods are called and what their implementation is.
