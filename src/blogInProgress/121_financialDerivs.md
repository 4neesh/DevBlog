<h4>Financial Derivatives</h4>
<p>
My last <a href="https://aneesh.co.uk/how-financial-institutions-use-commodities" target="_blank">blog</a> was the 2nd in my series on commodities where we took a look at the different ways a financial institution can influence commodity markets, and how a commodity can become traded. This blog will extend upon traded commodities to look at the main financial derivatives that can be created and the benefits they present. 
</p>
<p>
This blog will take a look at forwards, futures and swaps, while the next blog will look at option contracts, which are a little bit more complex. I will also use commodities as examples in these explanations, however note that they are not limited to just this asset class so where you see 'commodity', you can replace it with 'asset'.

<br>
<h4>Future</h4>
<p>
A future is a contractual obligation between two market participants to purchase/sell a given commodity, at a specific volume and price (known as the futures price) at a specified date in the future (the delivery date). The buyer of a future contract will benefit as they can guarantee the price of a commodity to be delivered at a date in the future. The seller in the future contract benefits from the guaranteed sale of a specific volume of commodity at a price in the future. Both participants benefit by removing the unknown price volatility for the asset at the future date.
</p>
<p>
One example may be an airline, who might like to use a future contract to fix the price of their jet fuel for the future. This fixing of price can help them to estimate costs of flights, and set prices of tickets. The supplier of jet fuel has a guaranteed sale, and the airline have a guaranteed price that is not impacted by the volatility of market price for jet fuel in the time-frame of the contract.
</p>
<p>
While a future has many practical benefits, they are not often seen to expiry as a financial derivative. Roughly 95% of futures contracts are settled before expiry, and the delivery of the asset is never made. The two counterparties in the contract will settle a difference in payment between the market rate and the futures price, known as 'marking to market'. For example, if a futures contract is made to buy one ounce of gold at £300 per ounce, and at expiry, the market value of gold is £310 an ounce, the seller of the contract will pay the buyer £10, as they are simply buying gold at £310, and selling it (at the futures price) of £300.

<h4>Over-the-counter vs Cleared trading</h4>
<p>
The difference between a future and a forward contract is made by where the trade is made. A futures contract is made through a centrally-cleared exchange. This means the participants in the contract will pay a small deposit (known as margin), typically 5% of the notional of the trade

at expiry, the contract is not often executed, and instead the difference between the market rate and the forward rate is paid from 1 ctpy to the other. this is known as marking to market
using a 'break' amount

com also use floating forwards where theforward price is not fixed, but is derived from a formula that uses the average spot price for a given time period.

<br>
<h4>Future</h4>
Traded on an exchange. 
Includes paying an initial margin to the central counterparty as a deposit against counterparty default. 
Includes more standardised commodities with it's own terms dictated by the broker. 
<br>
<h4>Swap</h4>
<p>
An exchange of cash flows, one is fixed and the other is floating. 
Used to hedge against the volatility in price of a commodity.
