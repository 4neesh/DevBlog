<h4>Title</h4>
<p>
The manner which trading book 'fair value' measurements have been defined in the past decade has changed amidst the financial crisis.
The most common valuation adjustment was CVA, this was later joined by DVA, FVA and even more to coin the term 'xVA'.

The financial crisis led to the rise in concerns of bank credit-worthiness and their stance as being 'too big to fail'. 
Due to a change in the view of credit risk for a bank, the interbank lending rates have been increasingly volatile. 
As a result, the the funding of derivatives, which historically relied upon unsecured borrowing to pay for, had become increasingly expensive.

Interbank funding, LIBOR and OIS. What are these and how do they differ?

<p>
New regulation within banking since the financial crisis has further extended to the capital banks must hold upon their books to limit the cost of their failure within the system.
Regulation will also require all derivatives that are traded over-the-counter (and not through a centrally-cleared exchange) to be sufficiently collateralised with margin. 
The introduction of this regulation has made the cost of trading OTC more expensive. With these additional costs have come additional valuation adjustments that are made to a 
derivative when priced upon the trading books.

CVA - Credit Valuation Adjustment

The CVA represents the discount upon the value of the derivative when accounting for the risk of counterparty default.
The calculation of the CVA can become complicated, it is often split into either the cost to hedge the risk of the default, or if there are derivative cashflows, 
forecasting and simulations of the cash flows can provide an array of potential exposures to the counterparty risk. 
Often, the risk of counterparty default can be hedged through other derivatives such as a credit default swap. The cost the hedge such risk will therefore be removed from the 
value of the derivative as a credit valuation adjustment - an adjustment made to the fair value of the derivative when accounting for the risk of counterparty default.

DVA - Debit Valuation Adjustment

The DVA is considered to be the counter of the CVA. Rather than accounting for the cost to the derivative from the counterpartys default, 
the DVA considers when the bank itself may default upon the derivative when it is out-of-the-money. 
In such a case, the counterparty would only be able to recover part of the value of the derivative, the remainder of which is considered a benefit to the bank
and is thus captured within the DVA as a gain.

FVA - Funding Valuation Adjustment

The time value of money is a well documented and used discount upon the fair value of a derivative, well before xVA had come about. 
The discount rate uses LIBOR or the Bank bill swap rate (BBSW) to model the risk-free appreciation in the derivative with time. 
The increase in cost volatility for interbank lending has given precendence to capture the cost of funding uncollateralised derivatives. 
FVA is split by the funding benefit adjustment (FBA) and funding cost adjustment (FCA). 
FBA correlates with DVA where a derivative has a negative market value and the bank accepts the position for cash. The cash raised from the position has come at a cost that reflects the banks credit quality (which is the rate they would have had to pay in the interbank market for).
Alternatively, if a derivative is purchased in-the-money, the bank is to pay cash for the position that will be funded at a cost that relates to the banks credit quality

CollVa - Collateral Valuation Adjustment

Margin is used by banks to mitigate the credit risk that is faced by their counterparty. The collateral is paid and kept on the opposing banks balance sheet. 
Therefore if a counterparty uses cash as collateral, the receiving bank will receive the interest rate, which is typically OIS. As a result, collateral is often a heavy point for optimisation to manage a banks exposure to OIS for their positions held. Without the cash margin paid by the counterparty however, the bank will need to hedge against the resulting counterparty risk at a potentially higher rate.

Capital Valuation Adjustment: KVA

Part of the Basel III framework introduced from the financial crisis required banks to increase the capital reserves they hold in relation to the derivatives they hold. The implementation and use of KVA is an ongoing change with regulatory management. 

</p>

<p>
Margin Valuation Adjustment (MVA)

All derivatives that are not centrally cleared from 2019 must have an initial and variation margin enforced. The MVA is dependent on the day-to-day changes in the mark to market as the value of the derivative changes. As a result, the MVA will reflect the banks position to comply with variation margin on a daily basis.
